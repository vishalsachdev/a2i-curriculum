# AI for Innovation (A²I) Curriculum

Welcome to the **Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence & Business Systems (A²I)** curriculum repository—an open-source, practice-based program that develops **system orchestrators** who align people, data, and intelligent agents toward verifiable business and societal value.

## Vision

The A²I program embraces a foundational insight: ***capability is cheap; coherence is scarce***. 

In a world where AI tools proliferate rapidly, the scarce skill is not mastering individual technologies but orchestrating them into coherent systems that deliver sustainable value while maintaining governance, trust, and inclusion. This program prepares leaders who can navigate this complexity through reflexive learning, ethical practice, and strategic systems thinking.

## What Makes A²I Different

> **"The first business degree designed for the AI era—where business leaders learn to orchestrate intelligence, not just consume it."**

- **Systems Orchestration Focus**: Learn to coordinate humans, data, and AI agents into reliable, governed workflows
- **Business Coherence Framework**: Measurable approach to assessing AI initiatives using established business frameworks (Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma, COBIT/ISO)
- **Mission-Driven**: Three domain tracks (Growth for Good, Finance for Inclusion, Healthcare for Humanity) with active industry partnerships
- **Innovation Leadership**: Three pathways (Corporate Innovation 60%, Venture Creation 25%, Social Innovation 15%) recognize diverse career goals

## Pedagogical Approach

A²I pedagogy unites six complementary models:

- **Reflexive Learning**: Students co-create knowledge artifacts, critique platforms, and reflect on the systems they build
- **Cyber-Social Learning**: Human ↔ AI ↔ peer feedback loops sustain continuous improvement
- **AI Feedback and Assessment**: Intelligent tools provide formative coaching rather than compliance policing
- **Empowerment ↔ Plasticity Framework**: Transform classrooms into adaptive ecosystems
- **Capabilities vs Skills**: Architect reusable capabilities rather than master transient tools
- **Business Coherence Scorecard**: Measurable framework using established business tools (Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma, COBIT/ISO, Stage-Gate) to assess and improve coherence

This design widens the program's ***coherence bandwidth***—the shared capacity of humans and machines to learn from and with one another—while providing concrete business metrics for measuring orchestration capability.

## Delivery Infrastructure

- **Canvas LMS**: Hosts assessments, peer review, and oral vivas with a consistent 8-week template
- **Coursera**: Delivers scalable asynchronous media for foundational content
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Provides BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Looker lab environments
- **GitHub**: Maintains open curriculum development, documentation, and automation workflows
