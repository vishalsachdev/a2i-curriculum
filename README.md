# AI for Innovation (A²I) Curriculum

Welcome to the **Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence & Business Systems (A²I)** curriculum repository—an open-source, practice-based program that develops **system orchestrators** who align people, data, and intelligent agents toward verifiable business and societal value.

## Vision

The A²I program embraces a foundational insight: ***capability is cheap; coherence is scarce***. 

In a world where AI tools proliferate rapidly, the scarce skill is not mastering individual technologies but orchestrating them into coherent systems that deliver sustainable value while maintaining governance, trust, and inclusion. This program prepares leaders who can navigate this complexity through reflexive learning, ethical practice, and strategic systems thinking.

## What Makes A²I Different

- **Systems Orchestration Focus**: Learn to coordinate humans, data, and AI agents into reliable, governed workflows—not just build models
- **Reflexive Learning**: Co-create knowledge with peers and AI through cycles of action, reflection, and public critique
- **Mission-Driven**: Three domain tracks (Growth for Good, Finance for Inclusion, Healthcare for Humanity) ground technical skills in real-world impact
- **Entrepreneurship Thread**: Integrated venture creation support through the iVenture Accelerator ecosystem
- **Open Development**: Transparent curriculum development on GitHub, inviting contributions from the global community

## Program Structure

### 36 Credits | 12 Courses | 8-Week Format

Designed for working professionals, the program delivers twelve 8-week courses combining asynchronous learning, applied projects, oral vivas, and AI-augmented feedback.

#### Core Courses (18 credits)
Six foundational courses establish shared literacy in orchestrating intelligent systems:

- **A²I 601 – AI Strategy & Problem Framing**: Position AI initiatives within organizational missions and diagnose coherence gaps
- **A²I 602 – Data & AI Infrastructure**: Design inclusive data architectures with observability and governance
- **A²I 603 – Evidence & Causality**: Apply experimental methods and fairness evaluation for trustworthy inference
- **A²I 604 – Predictive & Prescriptive AI**: Balance automation with human judgment in complex workflows
- **A²I 605 – Intelligent Agents & Workflows**: Architect multi-agent systems with safety guardrails and human-in-the-loop controls
- **A²I 606 – Governance & Trust Systems**: Translate regulatory and ethical requirements into design constraints

#### Applied Studios (9 credits)
Three project-intensive studios provide hands-on practice:

- **A²I 621 – Analytics Engineering Studio**: Build inclusive data pipelines and semantic layers on Google Cloud
- **A²I 622 – Data Product Studio**: Prototype deployable AI products with stakeholder review
- **A²I 623 – Agent Ops & Evaluation Studio**: Evaluate agentic workflows for reliability, safety, and observability

#### Electives & Domain Tracks (6 credits)
Mission-driven tracks contextualize core capabilities:

- **Growth for Good**: Equitable experimentation, ethical marketing, social impact metrics
- **Finance for Inclusion**: Inclusive credit modeling, RegTech automation, financial resilience
- **Healthcare for Humanity**: Care pathway intelligence, health data cooperatives, responsible diagnostics

Plus **A²I 643 – Venture Creation** for learners pursuing entrepreneurship.

#### Capstone (3 credits)
**A²I 699 – Intelligent Systems for Public Value**: Synthesize program threads through either a systems integration project with an organization or a venture launch supported by the iVenture Accelerator.

## Learning Outcomes

Graduates will be able to:

1. **Frame and Prioritize AI Portfolios** aligned with institutional purpose and stakeholder value
2. **Coordinate Human–AI Workflows** integrating automation, augmentation, and oversight
3. **Operationalize Governance and Trust** throughout data, model, and workflow lifecycles
4. **Engineer Reflexive Data Ecosystems** with observability and feedback mechanisms
5. **Generate and Interpret Causal Evidence** to validate system impact
6. **Lead Reflexive Learning Communities** using peer critique and AI-augmented feedback
7. **Activate Entrepreneurial Innovation** through ventures or organizational change initiatives
8. **Champion Access & Inclusion** in system design and governance practices

## Pedagogical Approach

A²I pedagogy unites five complementary models:

- **Reflexive Learning**: Students co-create knowledge artifacts, critique platforms, and reflect on the systems they build
- **Cyber-Social Learning**: Human ↔ AI ↔ peer feedback loops sustain continuous improvement
- **AI Feedback and Assessment**: Intelligent tools provide formative coaching rather than compliance policing
- **Empowerment ↔ Plasticity Framework**: Transform classrooms into adaptive ecosystems
- **Capabilities vs Skills**: Architect reusable capabilities rather than master transient tools

This design widens the program's ***coherence bandwidth***—the shared capacity of humans and machines to learn from and with one another.

## Delivery Infrastructure

- **Canvas LMS**: Hosts assessments, peer review, and oral vivas with a consistent 8-week template
- **Coursera**: Delivers scalable asynchronous media for foundational content
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Provides BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Looker lab environments
- **GitHub**: Maintains open curriculum development, documentation, and automation workflows
