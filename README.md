# A²I Curriculum Proposal: Applied AI for Impact

> **📋 STATUS: Curriculum Proposal**  
> This repository contains a comprehensive curriculum proposal for a **Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence & Business Systems (A²I)**. The program is currently in the planning and approval phase. This document presents the vision, pedagogical approach, market opportunity, and implementation considerations for leadership review.

---

Welcome to the **A²I curriculum proposal**—an innovative, practice-based graduate program designed to develop **system orchestrators** who can align people, data, and intelligent agents toward verifiable business and societal value.

## Vision

The proposed A²I program is built on a foundational insight: ***capability is cheap; coherence is scarce***. 

In a world where AI tools proliferate rapidly, the scarce skill is not mastering individual technologies but orchestrating them into coherent systems that deliver sustainable value while maintaining governance, trust, and inclusion. This program would prepare leaders who can navigate this complexity through reflexive learning, ethical practice, and strategic systems thinking.

## What Makes This Proposal Different

> **"A business degree designed for the AI era—where leaders learn to orchestrate intelligence, not just consume it."**

- **Business School Positioning**: Designed for leaders who manage AI initiatives, not build algorithms—bridging technical teams and business strategy
- **Systems Orchestration Focus**: Students would learn to coordinate humans, data, and AI agents into reliable, governed workflows
- **Business Coherence Framework**: Measurable approach to assessing AI initiatives using established business frameworks (Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma, COBIT/ISO)
- **Mission-Driven**: Three proposed domain tracks (Growth for Good, Finance for Inclusion, Healthcare for Humanity) with potential industry partnerships
- **Innovation Leadership**: Three pathways (Corporate Innovation 60%, Venture Creation 25%, Social Innovation 15%) would recognize diverse career goals
- **100% Online Global Delivery**: Designed for fully asynchronous-first delivery with AI-powered support, mobile optimization, and work-integrated learning
- **Open Development**: Transparent curriculum development on GitHub, inviting contributions from the global community

## Proposed Online Delivery Model

The A²I program would be designed from the ground up for exceptional online delivery:

## Proposed Program Structure

### 36 Credits | 12 Courses | 8-Week Format

Designed for working professionals, the proposed program would deliver twelve 8-week courses combining asynchronous learning, applied projects, oral vivas, and AI-augmented feedback.

#### Core Courses (24 credits)
Eight foundational courses would establish shared literacy in orchestrating intelligent systems, with business-focused additions:

- **A²I 601 – AI Strategy & Problem Framing**: Position AI initiatives, vendor evaluation, ROI analysis, build-vs-buy decisions
- **A²I 602 – Data & AI Infrastructure**: Design data architectures, data monetization, multi-vendor management
- **A²I 603 – Evidence & Causality**: Experimental methods, business impact assessment, ROI measurement
- **A²I 604 – Predictive & Prescriptive AI**: Balance automation with judgment, platform economics, pricing strategies
- **A²I 605 – Intelligent Agents & Workflows**: Architect multi-agent systems, change management, human-AI teams
- **A²I 606 – Governance & Trust Systems**: Regulatory requirements, COBIT/ISO frameworks, compliance
- **A²I 607 – AI Economics & Business Models**: Platform economics, pricing strategies, market dynamics, competitive positioning
- **A²I 608 – Leading AI Transformation**: Change management, building data cultures, executive communication, innovation labs

#### Applied Studios (9 credits)
Three project-intensive studios would provide hands-on practice:

- **A²I 621 – Analytics Engineering Studio**: Build inclusive data pipelines and semantic layers on Google Cloud
- **A²I 622 – Data Product Studio**: Prototype deployable AI products with stakeholder review
- **A²I 623 – Agent Ops & Evaluation Studio**: Evaluate agentic workflows for reliability, safety, and observability

#### Electives & Domain Tracks (3 credits)
Mission-driven tracks with potential industry partnerships would contextualize core capabilities:

- **Growth for Good**: Sustainable growth metrics, ESG integration, responsible marketing (Potential Partners: P&G, Patagonia, Shopify)
- **Finance for Inclusion**: Regulatory compliance, alternative credit, risk management (Potential Partners: Community banks, fintechs, Federal Reserve)
- **Healthcare for Humanity**: HIPAA compliance, clinical decision support, health equity (Potential Partners: Hospital systems, Epic, FDA)

Plus **A²I 643 – Innovation Leadership** would offer three pathways: Corporate Innovation (60%), Venture Creation (25%), Social Innovation (15%).

#### Capstone (3 credits)
**A²I 699 – Intelligent Systems for Public Value**: Students would synthesize program threads through either a systems integration project with an organization or a venture launch supported by the iVenture Accelerator.

## Proposed Learning Outcomes

Graduates would be **business leaders who manage AI initiatives, not build algorithms**—positioned as essential bridges between technical teams and business strategy. They would be able to:

### Strategic AI Leadership
1. **Frame and Prioritize AI Portfolios** using business frameworks (Balanced Scorecard, OKRs)
2. **Evaluate and Procure AI Capabilities** through vendor assessment and build-vs-buy analysis
3. **Develop Business Cases for AI** with ROI analysis and financial rigor
4. **Lead AI Transformation** driving organizational change and culture building

### Systems Orchestration
5. **Coordinate Human–AI Workflows** applying Lean and Six Sigma principles
6. **Operationalize Governance and Trust** using COBIT/ISO frameworks
7. **Measure Coherence** with Business Coherence Scorecard across five dimensions

### Business Fundamentals
8. **Apply AI Economics** understanding platform dynamics and competitive positioning
9. **Design AI Business Models** with sustainable pricing and value capture
10. **Navigate Regulatory Landscapes** across sectors (HIPAA, Basel, GDPR)

Plus outcomes in evidence-based decision making, innovation leadership, and creating multi-stakeholder value. See [full learning outcomes](docs/curriculum/learning_outcomes.md) for complete list of 19 proposed competencies.

## Proposed Pedagogical Approach

The A²I pedagogy would unite six complementary models:

- **Reflexive Learning**: Students co-create knowledge artifacts, critique platforms, and reflect on the systems they build
- **Cyber-Social Learning**: Human ↔ AI ↔ peer feedback loops sustain continuous improvement
- **AI Feedback and Assessment**: Intelligent tools provide formative coaching rather than compliance policing
- **Empowerment ↔ Plasticity Framework**: Transform classrooms into adaptive ecosystems
- **Capabilities vs Skills**: Architect reusable capabilities rather than master transient tools
- **Business Coherence Scorecard**: Measurable framework using established business tools (Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma, COBIT/ISO, Stage-Gate) to assess and improve coherence

This design would widen the program's ***coherence bandwidth***—the shared capacity of humans and machines to learn from and with one another—while providing concrete business metrics for measuring orchestration capability.

## Proposed Delivery Infrastructure

> **Note:** Platform selections would be finalized upon program approval based on institutional resources and partnerships.

- **Canvas LMS**: Could host assessments, peer review, and oral vivas with a consistent 8-week template
- **Coursera**: Could deliver scalable asynchronous media for foundational content
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Would provide BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Looker lab environments
- **GitHub**: Maintains open curriculum development, documentation, and automation workflows
