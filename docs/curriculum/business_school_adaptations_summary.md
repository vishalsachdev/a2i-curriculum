# Business School Adaptations: Implementation Summary

**Date:** November 11, 2024  
**Based on:** First-Principles Curriculum Review (November 2024)  
**Aligned with:** Online Delivery Adaptation Framework

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive updates made to the A²I curriculum to optimize it for business school delivery while maintaining the program's innovative vision. The adaptations embrace business school strengths (strategy, leadership, industry partnerships) while addressing business student needs (executive communication, ROI analysis, change management) and industry expectations (AI orchestration over algorithm development).

## Core Philosophy

> **"The first business degree designed for the AI era—where business leaders learn to orchestrate intelligence, not just consume it."**

The adaptations operationalize the program's central insight—*capability is cheap; coherence is scarce*—through business frameworks and metrics that resonate with practitioners and executives.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Innovation Leadership Framework (Replaces Single Entrepreneurship Track)

**Rationale:** Not all business students want to launch startups; most will lead AI transformation in existing organizations or social enterprises.

**Implementation:**
- Renamed "Entrepreneurship Thread" to "Innovation Leadership Thread"
- Created three distinct pathways with appropriate distribution:
  - **Corporate Innovation (60%)**: AI transformation in existing organizations
  - **Venture Creation (25%)**: Traditional startup path
  - **Social Innovation (15%)**: Public sector and social enterprise

**Updated Files:**
- `docs/entrepreneurship/venture_creation_course.md` → Now "Innovation Leadership in Intelligent Systems"
- `docs/entrepreneurship/innovation_studio.md` → Now "Innovation Studio & Leadership Ecosystem"
- `docs/curriculum/overview.md` → Updated thread description
- `docs/curriculum/electives.md` → Updated integration section

**Impact:**
- Better alignment with business school career outcomes
- Broader appeal to working professionals
- Maintains startup support through Venture Creation pathway
- Addresses corporate and civic sectors explicitly

### 2. Business Coherence Scorecard

**Rationale:** Abstract coherence concepts need concrete measurement using business frameworks that employers and students recognize.

**Implementation:**

  1. **Strategic Alignment** - Balanced Scorecard, OKR frameworks
  2. **Operational Efficiency** - Six Sigma, Lean methodologies
  3. **Stakeholder Value** - Multi-stakeholder value analysis
  4. **Risk Management** - COBIT/ISO governance frameworks
  5. **Innovation Pipeline** - Stage-Gate, Three Horizons model

**New Files:**
- `docs/pedagogy/business_coherence_scorecard.md` (comprehensive 500+ line document)
- Updated `docs/pedagogy/README.md` to include scorecard as 6th pedagogical model

**Features:**
- Maturity levels (1-5) for each dimension with scoring rubrics
- Business metrics and assessment methods for each dimension
- Workplace application protocol with manager verification
- Integration with learning pods and continuous assessment
