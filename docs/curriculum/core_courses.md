# Proposed Core Courses (A²I 601–608)

> **Note:** This document describes the proposed core curriculum. Course content, assessments, and delivery methods would be finalized during program development based on faculty input, institutional requirements, and industry feedback.

The eight-course core sequence would establish the shared mindset and toolkit required to orchestrate intelligent systems responsibly within business contexts. Each proposed 8-week course would blend asynchronous content delivery, discussions, applied projects, executive presentations, and AI-augmented feedback.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L44-L108】

## Proposed 8-Week Business Cycle Format

Each course would follow a business sprint cycle structure that mirrors real organizational rhythms, teaching students to think in terms of rapid iteration and executive communication:

| Week Phase | Business Context | Learning Activities | Deliverables |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Weeks 1-2** | Problem Framing & Stakeholder Alignment | Strategic planning, stakeholder analysis, coherence baseline | Opportunity canvas, stakeholder map, Business Coherence Scorecard assessment |
| **Weeks 3-4** | Rapid Prototype / Proof of Concept | MVP development, technical feasibility testing | Working prototype, architecture documentation, demo video |
| **Weeks 5-6** | Business Case Development | Financial modeling, risk assessment, resource planning | ROI analysis, risk register, governance framework |
| **Weeks 7-8** | Executive Presentation & Governance Review | Board preparation, stakeholder communication, reflection | 15-min executive presentation, Q&A defense, implementation roadmap, reflection essay |

**Pedagogical Rationale:**
- **Mimics Real Business Cycles:** Students learn to operate in compressed timeframes similar to quarterly planning
- **MVP Thinking:** Emphasis on rapid prototyping and "good enough to decide" rather than perfect solutions
- **Executive Briefing Skills:** Regular practice communicating to decision-makers rather than technical peers
- **Coherence Assessment:** Business Coherence Scorecard tracking throughout provides continuous improvement framework
