# Curriculum Overview

## Vision

The Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Business Systems (A²I) develops **system orchestrators** who can align people, data, and intelligent agents toward verifiable business and societal value. The program embraces the insight that *capability is cheap; coherence is scarce* and therefore focuses on leadership, governance, and reflexive learning with AI.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L1-L138】

## Program Structure

- **Credits & Cadence:** 36 credits delivered across twelve 8-week courses designed for working professionals. Every course follows a shared Canvas template with Week 0 orientation, Weeks 1–8 learning cycles, and Week 8 viva and reflection.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L44-L92】
- **Delivery Ecosystem:** Coursera scales asynchronous content, Canvas anchors graded and synchronous elements, Google Cloud powers labs, and GitHub houses the open development repository for transparency.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L56-L76】

### Core Courses
Six foundational courses (A²I 601–606) establish shared literacy in strategy, infrastructure, causality, intelligent workflows, and governance.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L94-L119】

### Studios & Capstone
Three applied studios (A²I 621–623) provide hands-on practice, culminating in A²I 699 where students integrate systems for public value or launch ventures.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L121-L155】

### Domain Tracks & Electives
Electives are organized into mission-driven tracks—Growth for Good, Finance for Inclusion, and Healthcare for Humanity—so learners can contextualize core capabilities in high-impact domains.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L129-L137】

### Entrepreneurship Thread
Entrepreneurship is woven throughout via the venture creation elective (A²I 643), iVenture Accelerator support, and modules on opportunity recognition, funding, and commercialization.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L157-L177】

## Pedagogical Framework

A²I pedagogy unites five complementary models—**Reflexive Learning**, **Cyber-Social Learning**, **AI Feedback and Assessment**, **Empowerment ↔ Plasticity Framework**, and **Capabilities vs Skills**—to transform classrooms into adaptive ecosystems.
Students and intelligent agents co-create knowledge through cycles of action and reflection, peer critique, and open governance, learning to architect reusable capabilities rather than master transient tools.
This design widens the program's *coherence bandwidth*: the shared capacity of humans and machines to learn from and with one another.
See [Pedagogy Overview](../pedagogy/README.md) for details.

## Learning Philosophy

The learning model blends reflexive, cyber-social, and AI-augmented pedagogy:

- **Reflexive Learning:** Students co-create knowledge artifacts, critique platforms, and reflect on the systems they build.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L179-L214】
- **Cyber-Social Learning:** Human ↔ AI ↔ peer feedback loops sustain continuous improvement and transparency.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L207-L214】
- **AI as Cognitive Partner:** Intelligent tools provide formative assessment, analytics, and coaching rather than policing compliance.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L197-L205】
- **Practice-Based:** Every course centers on applied projects, oral vivas, and peer critique to demonstrate coherent outcomes.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L80-L108】

## Delivery Infrastructure

- **Canvas LMS:** Hosts assessments, peer review, and oral vivas.
- **Coursera:** Delivers scalable asynchronous media.
- **Google Cloud Platform:** Provides BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Looker lab environments.
- **GitHub:** Maintains open curriculum development and documentation workflows.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L56-L76】
