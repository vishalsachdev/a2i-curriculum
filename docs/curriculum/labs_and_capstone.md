# Studios and Capstone

## Applied Studios (A²I 621–623)

Each studio is an 8-week, project-intensive experience that immerses learners in the practice of orchestrating intelligent systems on Google Cloud infrastructure with open collaboration in GitHub.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L56-L124】

### A²I 621 – Analytics Engineering Studio
- Build inclusive data pipelines and semantic layers in BigQuery and Looker.
- Operationalize data quality checks, lineage, and access policies.
- Deliver reproducible analytics artifacts ready for enterprise deployment.

### A²I 622 – Data Product Studio
- Translate opportunity statements into deployable AI products.
- Prototype services using Vertex AI, managed APIs, and automation frameworks.
- Conduct peer and stakeholder reviews emphasizing coherence and value realization.

### A²I 623 – Agent Ops & Evaluation Studio
- Evaluate agentic workflows for reliability, safety, and guardrail coverage.
- Implement evaluation harnesses, red-teaming rituals, and observability dashboards.
- Document human-in-the-loop protocols and escalation procedures.

### Studio Experience
- Weekly design reviews and peer critique circles.
- Shared telemetry dashboards to surface progress and risks.
- Integration with Canvas oral vivas and AI-augmented coaching.

## Capstone (A²I 699 – Intelligent Systems for Public Value)

### Purpose
Learners synthesize program threads by delivering an authentic system that advances public or organizational value while demonstrating governance, entrepreneurship, and reflexive practice.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】

### Tracks
1. **Systems Integration Project** – Partner with an organization to orchestrate data, agents, and human teams into a coherent workflow.
2. **Venture Launch Project** – Pursue a startup concept supported by the iVenture Accelerator, culminating in a public demo and venture plan.

### Core Requirements
- Formal proposal and stakeholder charter by Week 2.
- Iterative build logs and observability dashboards reviewed bi-weekly.
- Week 8 viva with faculty, peers, and external advisors.
- Public artifact (whitepaper, product, or policy playbook) licensed for community learning.

### Support Ecosystem
- Faculty mentors with governance, technical, and venture expertise.
- Industry advisors aligned with the program’s domain tracks.
- Access to Google Cloud resources, GitHub Actions automation, and AI tooling.
- Integration with entrepreneurship programming (Origin Ventures Office, iVenture, Strategy & Innovation faculty).

### Assessment Alignment
- **Applied Impact (40%)** – Demonstrated value, alignment with mission, and stakeholder adoption.
- **Governance & Trust (25%)** – Clarity of controls, accountability, and ethical considerations.
- **Technical & Operational Excellence (20%)** – Reliability, observability, and integration quality.
- **Reflection & Leadership (15%)** – Viva performance, reflective essays, and peer feedback contributions.
