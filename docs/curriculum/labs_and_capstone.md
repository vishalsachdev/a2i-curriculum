- Design and implement an AI solution
- Evaluate performance and impact
- Present findings to stakeholders
- Document the entire process

### Project Types

1. **Research Projects**: Novel approaches to AI challenges
2. **Application Projects**: Practical solutions to real problems
3. **Entrepreneurial Projects**: Viable products or services
4. **Social Impact Projects**: AI for good initiatives

### Capstone Support

- Faculty advisors
- Industry mentors
- Peer collaboration
- AI-assisted development tools
- Access to computing resources

### Deliverables
