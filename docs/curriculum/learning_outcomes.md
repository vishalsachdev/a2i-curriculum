## Course Alignment

Each core course, studio, and elective documents specific outcomes that map back to these program competencies. Course-level matrices live alongside syllabi within the curriculum repository for iterative improvement.

## Assessment Approach

Learning outcomes are evidenced through:
- Applied projects, labs, and studio artifacts (50%).
- Automated knowledge checks and analytics dashboards (20%).
- Oral vivas and reflective essays (20%).
- Peer critique and community contribution (10%).【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L80-L108】

Capstone evaluations integrate impact, governance, technical excellence, and leadership dimensions to ensure coherence across program threads.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】

## Continuous Improvement

Outcomes undergo review during monthly governance rituals and quarterly roadmap checkpoints, incorporating feedback from students, faculty, industry advisors, and the broader community. Updates reference the living conversation history to maintain alignment with the founding vision.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L9-L22】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
