19. **Create Multi-Stakeholder Value** – Balance needs of customers, employees, shareholders, regulators, and communities rather than optimizing for single-stakeholder interests.

## Course Alignment

Each core course, studio, and elective documents specific outcomes that map back to these program competencies. Course-level matrices live alongside syllabi within the curriculum repository for iterative improvement.

## Assessment Approach (Business School Aligned)

Learning outcomes are evidenced through business-appropriate assessment methods that mirror real executive decision-making contexts:

- **Business Cases & Projects (30%)** – Real-world AI implementation scenarios with financial analysis, stakeholder impact assessment, and strategic alignment evaluation.
- **Team Executive Proposals (30%)** – Cross-functional AI initiative proposals with board-ready presentations, ROI justification, and governance frameworks.
- **Portfolio Documentation (25%)** – Continuous documentation of learning, application, and reflection through GitHub and professional artifacts, including Business Coherence Scorecard tracking.
- **360 Peer Reviews (15%)** – Leadership, collaboration, and professional skills assessment by pod members and peers, emphasizing soft skills critical for business leadership.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L80-L108】

**Note:** Traditional "auto-checks" have been replaced with case discussions, business simulations, and executive presentation formats that better assess business leadership competencies rather than technical knowledge recall.

Capstone evaluations integrate business impact, governance maturity, stakeholder value creation, and leadership effectiveness to ensure coherence across program threads.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】

### Assessment Philosophy

The assessment approach reflects the business school context:
- **Decision Frameworks over Algorithmic Understanding** – Students learn to evaluate and choose rather than build from scratch
- **Executive Communication over Technical Documentation** – Emphasis on translating complexity for business audiences
- **ROI and Business Impact over Technical Metrics** – Success measured by organizational value creation
- **Leadership and Collaboration over Individual Technical Performance** – Soft skills weighted equally with analytical capabilities

## Continuous Improvement

Outcomes undergo review during monthly governance rituals and quarterly roadmap checkpoints, incorporating feedback from students, faculty, industry advisors, and the broader community. Updates reference the living conversation history to maintain alignment with the founding vision.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L9-L22】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
