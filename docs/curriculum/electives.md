# Proposed Electives & Domain Tracks

> **Note:** This document describes proposed elective courses and industry partnerships. Domain tracks, partnerships, and course offerings would be finalized upon program approval based on institutional resources and industry engagement.

## Purpose

Electives would deepen expertise within mission-driven domains so learners can translate core orchestration skills into sector-specific impact. Offerings would evolve through open contribution but are organized around three anchor tracks identified in the founding conversation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L129-L137】

## Proposed Track Overview

Each domain track would be structured as an **industry consortium** with active partnerships that would provide real-world context, mentorship, and pathways to employment. This approach would leverage business school strengths in industry relationships while ensuring curriculum remains current with sector needs.

- Co-sponsor capstone projects with funding and data access

**Advisory Board Structure:**
- 6-8 industry practitioners (mix of enterprise and startup)
- 2 faculty co-chairs (business school + domain expert)
- 1 student representative (rotating each semester)
- 1 civic/nonprofit representative (mission alignment)

**Meeting Cadence:**
- Quarterly strategic reviews (2 hours, virtual)
- Annual in-person symposium at Gies
- Ongoing async collaboration via Slack channels
- Student showcase events (2x per year)

## Innovation Leadership Integration

- **A²I 643 – Innovation Leadership in Intelligent Systems:** Required elective offering three pathways (Corporate Innovation, Venture Creation, Social Innovation) to prepare students for diverse leadership roles in AI transformation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L157-L177】
- Domain tracks collaborate with the Innovation Studio, iVenture Accelerator, Origin Ventures Office, and industry partners to support all three pathways:
  - **Corporate Innovation:** Industry partners provide transformation case studies and pilot opportunities
  - **Venture Creation:** Startup ecosystem connections and funding pathways
  - **Social Innovation:** Civic partnerships and social enterprise support

## Elective Experience

- 8-week modules aligned with the Canvas template, integrating Coursera content, applied assignments, and oral vivas.
- Cross-track studios encourage interdisciplinary teams tackling shared challenges.
- Open GitHub repositories capture syllabi, artifacts, and evaluation rubrics for community iteration.

## Proposing New Electives

Community members may suggest additions via the curriculum governance process. Proposals should specify:
- Domain alignment and stakeholder need.
- How the course reinforces coherence, governance, and inclusion.
- Required partnerships (industry, civic, research) and resource implications.
- Assessment strategy leveraging AI-augmented feedback.
