# Electives & Domain Tracks

## Purpose

Electives deepen expertise within mission-driven domains so learners can translate core orchestration skills into sector-specific impact. Offerings evolve through open contribution but are organized around three anchor tracks identified in the founding conversation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L129-L137】

## Track Overview

### Growth for Good
Focuses on equitable experimentation, ethical marketing, and customer journeys that prioritize inclusion and trust.

**Sample Electives**
- Responsible Growth Analytics (experiment design for inclusive outcomes)
- Human-Centered Marketing Automation (journey orchestration with guardrails)
- Social Impact Metrics Studio (measuring mission-aligned value)

### Finance for Inclusion
Equips learners to design financial systems that expand access while maintaining compliance and risk controls.

**Sample Electives**
- Inclusive Credit & Risk Modeling (alternative data, fairness audits)
- RegTech & Compliance Automation (governance workflows across regulators)
- Financial Resilience Analytics (forecasting and stress testing for underserved communities)

### Healthcare for Humanity
Centers on access, outcomes, and ethical deployment of intelligent systems in health contexts.

**Sample Electives**
- Care Pathway Intelligence (workflow orchestration across clinicians and agents)
- Health Data Cooperatives (governance models for community-owned data)
- Responsible Diagnostics & Triage (evaluation frameworks for clinical agents)

## Entrepreneurship Integration

- **A²I 643 – Venture Creation in Intelligent Systems:** Required for learners pursuing the venture capstone path; covers opportunity assessment, lean experimentation, funding models, and go-to-market strategy.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L157-L177】
- Domain tracks collaborate with the iVenture Accelerator, Origin Ventures Office, and industry mentors to incubate new ventures and partnerships.

## Elective Experience

- 8-week modules aligned with the Canvas template, integrating Coursera content, applied assignments, and oral vivas.
- Cross-track studios encourage interdisciplinary teams tackling shared challenges.
- Open GitHub repositories capture syllabi, artifacts, and evaluation rubrics for community iteration.

## Proposing New Electives

Community members may suggest additions via the curriculum governance process. Proposals should specify:
- Domain alignment and stakeholder need.
- How the course reinforces coherence, governance, and inclusion.
- Required partnerships (industry, civic, research) and resource implications.
- Assessment strategy leveraging AI-augmented feedback.
