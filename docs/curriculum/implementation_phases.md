# Implementation Phases for Business School Adaptation

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation of recommendations from the First-Principles Curriculum Review (November 2024) that repositions the A²I program for optimal delivery within the business school context. The implementation balances immediate improvements with longer-term structural changes while maintaining alignment with online delivery principles.

## Implementation Philosophy

The phased approach reflects several key principles:

1. **Start with Assessment:** Changes that most directly impact student experience and outcomes
2. **Leverage Existing Strengths:** Build on business school capabilities rather than importing CS models
3. **Industry First:** Establish partnerships that validate curriculum relevance
4. **Iterative Learning:** Each phase includes feedback loops to inform subsequent phases
5. **Faculty Development:** Parallel track ensures instructors are prepared for business-focused delivery
6. **Online Delivery Compatible:** All changes align with asynchronous-first, work-integrated learning model
