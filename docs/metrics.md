# A²I Program Success Metrics

## Purpose

This document defines success metrics for the A²I program, operationalizing the core philosophy—**"Capability is cheap; coherence is scarce"**—into measurable indicators across five strategic themes. These metrics guide continuous improvement and demonstrate the program's commitment to coherence, inclusion, entrepreneurship, governance, and open development.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L230】

## Core Success Themes

### 1. Coherence

**Indicator:** Percentage of courses demonstrating clear alignment between strategy, evidence, infrastructure, and governance deliverables.

**Assessment Methods:**
- Course-level coherence audits using the Business Coherence Scorecard【F:docs/pedagogy/business_coherence_scorecard.md】
- Student capstone project coherence scores (target: ≥60 overall, no dimension <40)
- Cross-course learning outcome alignment matrices
- Stakeholder feedback on curriculum integration

**Key Metrics:**
- Average student coherence score improvement from baseline to capstone
- Percentage of courses with documented strategic-operational-governance alignment
- Faculty self-assessment of coherence integration (annual survey)
- External evaluator ratings of program coherence (biennial review)

**Philosophy Connection:**
Coherence is the program's defining differentiator. These metrics ensure we consistently deliver on our promise to develop "system orchestrators" who align people, data, and AI agents toward business value.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L109】

### 2. Inclusion

**Indicator:** Representation of underserved learners in domain tracks and venture residencies; accessibility compliance across platforms.

**Assessment Methods:**
- Demographic analysis of enrolled students vs. target population
- Accessibility audits of Canvas, Coursera, and GCP platforms
- Student feedback on inclusive learning environment
- Financial aid and scholarship utilization tracking

**Key Metrics:**
- Percentage of students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM/business
- Percentage of students from rural and economically disadvantaged regions
- Platform accessibility compliance scores (WCAG 2.1 AA standard)
- Scholarship coverage as percentage of total enrollment
- Student satisfaction with inclusive environment (survey scores)

**Philosophy Connection:**
Aligned with UIUC's land-grant mission, A²I prioritizes access and inclusion. We train diverse orchestrators who bring varied perspectives to AI governance and systems thinking.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】

### 3. Entrepreneurship

**Indicator:** Number of ventures/incubations progressing to capstone launch with documented public value outcomes.

**Assessment Methods:**
- Venture progress tracking through A²I 643 and A²I 699 capstone pathways
- iVenture Accelerator collaboration metrics
- Public value outcome documentation (jobs created, problems solved, communities served)
- Stakeholder charter quality and completion rates

**Key Metrics:**
- Number of ventures launched through capstone projects (annual count)
- Percentage of ventures with external stakeholder validation
- Public value outcomes documented (qualitative and quantitative)
- Post-graduation venture survival rate (1-year, 3-year)
- Innovation Studio engagement (governance clinics, workshops attended)

**Philosophy Connection:**
Entrepreneurship is reframed as venture creation that prioritizes public value and coherent stakeholder alignment, not just profit maximization. Students learn to build ventures that orchestrate ecosystems.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L116-L135】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】

### 4. Governance

**Indicator:** Frequency and quality of governance ritual outputs, including AI-use audits and data stewardship reports.

**Assessment Methods:**
- Monthly governance ritual completion tracking
- Quality scoring of AI-use audits using rubrics from A²I 606
- Data stewardship report reviews
- Canvas analytics and AI feedback logs analysis
- Repository contribution patterns

**Key Metrics:**
- Percentage of students completing monthly governance rituals
- Quality scores for governance deliverables (rubric-based)
- AI-use charter compliance rates across courses
- Data privacy and ethical AI incident reports (target: proactive identification, rapid resolution)
- GitHub contribution patterns (transparency and community engagement)

**Philosophy Connection:**
Governance is not compliance theater but "governance-as-innovation"—a reflexive practice where students interrogate the systems they build. Metrics track both participation and quality of governance thinking.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】

---

### 5. Open Development

**Indicator:** Volume of community contributions, PR cycle times, and transparency of changelog updates.

**Assessment Methods:**
- GitHub repository analytics (issues, PRs, commits, contributors)
- Community contribution diversity (students, faculty, industry partners)
- Documentation quality and accessibility audits
- Transparency of decision-making (public conversation updates)

**Key Metrics:**
- Number of community contributions (PRs merged, issues resolved)
- Average PR cycle time (target: <7 days for curriculum updates)
- Contributor diversity (percentage from outside core faculty)
- Documentation completeness score (automated linting, peer review)
- Public dashboard update frequency (monthly minimum)

**Philosophy Connection:**
Open development embodies transparency and collective intelligence. Public GitHub development models the "cyber-social learning" pedagogy—students learn by contributing to an evolving, open curriculum.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

## Integration with Business Coherence Scorecard

The five program success themes (Coherence, Inclusion, Entrepreneurship, Governance, Open Development) align with and extend the five dimensions of the Business Coherence Scorecard:【F:docs/pedagogy/business_coherence_scorecard.md】

| Program Theme | Scorecard Dimension | Alignment |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Coherence** | All Five Dimensions | Program-level coherence ensures each course develops student capability across strategic alignment, operational efficiency, stakeholder value, risk management, and innovation pipeline |
| **Inclusion** | Stakeholder Value | Diverse learner representation ensures multiple perspectives inform coherence assessments and stakeholder value evaluations |
| **Entrepreneurship** | Innovation Pipeline + Strategic Alignment | Venture creation pathways operationalize innovation pipeline management and strategic coherence |
| **Governance** | Risk Management & Governance | Program-level governance rituals model the same practices students learn to apply in organizations |
| **Open Development** | Operational Efficiency + Innovation Pipeline | Transparent, collaborative curriculum development demonstrates continuous improvement culture |

## Philosophical Foundation

These metrics operationalize the A²I program's core insight:

> **"Capability is cheap; coherence is scarce."**

We measure not just student technical skills (capability) but their ability to orchestrate people, data, and AI systems toward coherent outcomes. Success metrics emphasize:

1. **Alignment over execution:** Do initiatives connect strategy, operations, and governance?
2. **Orchestration over optimization:** Do solutions balance multiple stakeholder needs?
3. **Reflexivity over compliance:** Do governance practices enable learning and adaptation?
4. **Public value over private gain:** Do entrepreneurial ventures create shared prosperity?
5. **Transparency over control:** Does open development build collective intelligence?

---

## Continuous Evolution

This metrics framework itself evolves through program governance:

**Update Process:**
1. Quarterly metric review during faculty meetings
2. Annual comprehensive review at program retreat
3. Student and advisory board feedback incorporation
4. GitHub issue tracking for proposed metric improvements
5. Public changelog updates documenting metric evolution

**Version History:**
- **v1.0 (November 2025):** Initial metrics framework, consolidating success indicators from founding documents
