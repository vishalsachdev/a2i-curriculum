# A²I 643 – Venture Creation in Intelligent Systems

## Course Purpose

A²I 643 equips learners to translate mission-aligned insights into ventures that honor governance, evidence, and inclusion commitments. It serves as the gateway to the venture-oriented capstone track and the Innovation Studio residency.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L116-L135】

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the 8-week module, learners will:

1. Frame opportunities that reflect UIUC’s access mission and the program’s domain tracks (Growth for Good, Finance for Inclusion, Healthcare for Humanity).【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L114】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】
