*Date: November 11, 2024*  
*Author: Curriculum Review Team*

## Executive Summary

This document presents a first-principles review of the A²I curriculum with specific consideration for its implementation within a business school context. The review acknowledges the program's innovative vision while providing pragmatic recommendations that align with business school capabilities, student expectations, and industry needs.

## Context: Business School Realities

Business schools operate within specific constraints and opportunities that shape curriculum design:

1. **Student Profile**: Working professionals seeking immediate applicability, not theoretical depth
2. **Faculty Expertise**: Strong in strategy, operations, and organizational behavior; limited in pure CS/math
3. **Industry Expectations**: Employers want leaders who can manage AI initiatives, not build algorithms
4. **Resource Constraints**: Limited capacity for deep technical infrastructure
5. **Competitive Positioning**: Differentiation through business application, not technical innovation

## Revised Recommendations

### 1. Embrace Business School Strengths

#### Original Concern: Theory-Practice Imbalance
**Business School Reality**: Deep mathematical foundations are neither expected nor feasible in a business school context.

**Revised Recommendation:**
- Replace mathematical rigor with **business rigor**: financial modeling, ROI analysis, risk assessment
- Focus on **decision frameworks** rather than algorithmic understanding
- Teach students to evaluate and procure AI capabilities, not build them
- Develop strong vendor management and technology assessment skills

**Implementation:**
```
A²I 601 Enhancement: Add modules on:
- AI vendor evaluation frameworks
- Build vs. buy decision matrices
- Technology readiness assessment
- Cost-benefit analysis for AI initiatives
```

### 2. Operationalize "Coherence" Through Business Metrics

#### Original Concern: Coherence Bandwidth Paradox
**Business School Reality**: Abstract concepts need concrete business applications.

**Revised Recommendation:**
Define coherence through established business frameworks:

| Coherence Dimension | Business Metric | Assessment Method |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Strategic Alignment | AI initiatives mapped to strategic objectives | Balanced scorecard integration |
| Operational Efficiency | Process optimization metrics | Six Sigma/Lean frameworks |
| Stakeholder Value | Multi-stakeholder impact assessment | Stakeholder value maps |
| Risk Management | Governance maturity scores | COBIT/ISO frameworks |
| Innovation Pipeline | Portfolio coherence score | Stage-gate evaluation |

**Implementation:**
- Create a "Coherence Scorecard" tool students use throughout the program
- Develop case studies showing coherent vs. incoherent AI implementations
- Partner with companies to assess real AI initiative coherence

### 3. Leverage the 8-Week Format as a Feature

#### Original Concern: Scale and Complexity Mismatch
**Business School Reality**: Working professionals need modular, intensive formats.

**Revised Recommendation:**
Transform the constraint into a strength:
- Position 8-week sprints as mimicking real business cycles
- Teach "MVP thinking" for AI initiatives
- Focus on rapid prototyping and iteration
- Emphasize executive briefing skills over deep implementation

**Course Structure Enhancement:**
```
Weeks 1-2: Problem framing and stakeholder alignment
Weeks 3-4: Rapid prototype/proof of concept
Weeks 5-6: Business case development
Weeks 7-8: Executive presentation and governance review
```

### 4. Reframe Assessment for Business Context

#### Original Concern: Assessment Coherence Gap
**Business School Reality**: Business schools excel at case-based and presentation assessments.

**Revised Recommendation:**

| Assessment Type | Weight | Business School Approach |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Business Cases | 30% | AI implementation scenarios with financial analysis |
| Team Projects | 30% | Cross-functional AI initiative proposals |
| Executive Presentations | 25% | Board-ready recommendations with Q&A |
| Peer 360 Reviews | 15% | Leadership and collaboration assessment |

Remove "auto-checks" entirely—replace with case discussions and business simulations.

### 5. Integrate, Don't Proliferate Platforms

#### Original Concern: Platform Proliferation
**Business School Reality**: Business students are comfortable with diverse tools but need business-relevant integration.

**Revised Recommendation:**
- Position multiple platforms as "enterprise ecosystem reality"
- Teach platform integration as a core competency
- Create a executive dashboard that aggregates insights
- Frame this as "multi-vendor management" skill

**Business Integration Framework:**
```
Canvas → "Corporate LMS"
Coursera → "External training platform"
GitHub → "Enterprise collaboration system"
Google Cloud → "Cloud vendor environment"
```

### 6. Strengthen Domain Tracks Through Industry Partnerships

#### Original Concern: Domain Track Depth
**Business School Reality**: Business schools excel at industry partnerships.

**Revised Recommendation:**
Transform each track into an industry consortium:

**Growth for Good**
- Partner: Major CPG companies, B-Corps
- Focus: Sustainable growth metrics, ESG integration
- Deliverable: Industry-ready growth playbooks

**Finance for Inclusion**
- Partner: Community banks, fintech startups
- Focus: Regulatory compliance, risk management
- Deliverable: Compliance-ready AI governance frameworks

**Healthcare for Humanity**
- Partner: Hospital systems, health tech companies
- Focus: HIPAA compliance, clinical decision support
- Deliverable: FDA-pathway documentation

### 7. Position Entrepreneurship as "Innovation Leadership"

#### Original Concern: Entrepreneurship Thread Tension
**Business School Reality**: Not all business students want to be entrepreneurs.

**Revised Recommendation:**
Reframe as three pathways:

1. **Corporate Innovation** (60% of students)
   - Leading AI transformation in existing organizations
   - Intrapreneurship and innovation labs
   - Change management and digital transformation

2. **Venture Creation** (25% of students)
   - Traditional startup path
   - Alignment with iVenture Accelerator
   - VC-ready pitch development

3. **Social Innovation** (15% of students)
   - Public sector transformation
   - NGO/nonprofit applications
   - Social enterprise models

### 8. Add Business Fundamentals for AI Leaders

#### New Addition: Business School Unique Value
**Business School Opportunity**: Teach what CS programs cannot.

**Recommended Additions:**

**A²I 607 – AI Economics and Business Models** (New Core Course)
- Platform economics and network effects
- AI pricing strategies and value capture
- Market structure and competitive dynamics
- Regulation and antitrust considerations

**A²I 608 – Leading AI Transformation** (New Core Course)
- Change management for AI adoption
- Building data-driven cultures
- Managing human-AI teams
- Stakeholder communication and AI literacy

### 9. Develop Business School-Appropriate Foundations

#### Original Concern: Missing Theoretical Elements
**Business School Reality**: Theory must be business-relevant.

**Revised Foundation Modules:**

Instead of mathematical foundations, add:
- **Strategic Thinking for AI**: Competitive advantage, value chains, business models
- **Organizational Behavior in AI Context**: Trust, adoption, resistance, culture
- **AI Governance for Executives**: Regulatory landscape, compliance, risk management
- **Data Strategy for Business Leaders**: Data as asset, governance, monetization

### 10. Create Business-Relevant Research Methods

#### Original Concern: Missing Research Methods
**Business School Reality**: Business research methods differ from CS research.

**Business Research Approach:**
- Case study methodology for AI implementations
- ROI measurement and business impact assessment
- Stakeholder research and voice-of-customer for AI products
- A/B testing for business metrics, not just technical performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Perceived as "AI-lite" by technical audiences
**Mitigation**: Position explicitly as "AI for Business Leaders" not "AI Engineering"

### Risk: Faculty readiness for AI content
**Mitigation**: Partner with CS department for technical modules; focus business faculty on application

### Risk: Rapidly changing AI landscape
**Mitigation**: Modular curriculum design; quarterly content refresh cycles; industry advisory input

## Competitive Positioning

Position the A²I program as:
> "The first business degree designed for the AI era—where business leaders learn to orchestrate intelligence, not just consume it."

Key differentiators:
1. **Systems Orchestration Focus**: Unlike technical programs
2. **Governance-First Design**: Unlike innovation-only programs
3. **Industry-Integrated**: Unlike academic-only programs
4. **Mission-Driven**: Unlike profit-only programs

## Conclusion

By embracing its business school context rather than fighting it, the A²I curriculum can deliver on its innovative vision while remaining practical and immediately applicable. The key is translating the profound insight—"capability is cheap; coherence is scarce"—into business language and frameworks that resonate with business students and employers.

The program should not try to compete with computer science departments on technical depth but instead leverage business school strengths: strategy, leadership, organizational behavior, and industry partnerships. This positions A²I graduates as the essential bridge between technical teams and business strategy—the orchestrators who ensure AI delivers real value.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Convene Industry Advisory Board** to validate business-focused recommendations
2. **Pilot Business Coherence Scorecard** with current students
3. **Develop Business Case Library** starting with 10 flagship cases
4. **Launch Faculty Development Program** focused on AI business applications
5. **Create Executive Preview Program** to test market positioning
