## Most Impactful Articles for A2I Curriculum

### Article 1: The Critical Thinking Gap: Why Good Intentions Aren't Enough
**Author:** Michelle D. Miller

**Key Contribution:** Addresses the universal challenge that while critical thinking is valued across faculty, leadership, and industry, educational outcomes consistently fall short. Provides evidence-based strategies for bridging this gap.

**Relevance Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Summary:** Miller identifies that critical thinking is both a skill and a disposition problem requiring effortful practice aligned to disciplinary contexts. The article emphasizes that critical thinking cannot be taught abstractly but must be practiced within specific domains (like AI/ML). Key strategies include: deliberate practice aligned to discipline-specific critical thinking, active learning over passive content consumption, and addressing the cognitive effort barrier that makes students default to easier reasoning.

**Why Critical for A2I:** AI/ML students must critically evaluate models, question assumptions, identify biases, and make ethical decisions—all requiring domain-specific critical thinking. This article provides actionable frameworks for teaching these skills.

### Article 2: Cocreating Agile Academic Integrity Guiding Principles for AI with Equity
**Authors:** Hoda Mostafa, Maha Bali, and Yasser Atef Tamer

**Key Contribution:** Presents a codesign methodology for developing agile, inclusive guidelines for GenAI use in classrooms that balance academic integrity with equity considerations.

**Relevance Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Summary:** Describes a collaborative approach to creating AI usage guidelines by involving students, faculty, and staff in structured "Conversation Café" sessions. The framework emphasizes: agility to adapt to rapidly changing AI landscape, equity to ensure all student voices shape policies, transparency about when/how AI use is appropriate, and continuous iteration based on community input. Provides a 5-step process for running cocreation sessions.

**Why Critical for A2I:** A2I students will be AI practitioners and must understand ethical AI use from an educational perspective. This article provides a model for developing course-specific AI policies that the curriculum itself should adopt and teach students to implement in their future work.

---

### Article 3: Timeless Teaching, Modern Challenges: Ensuring Learning in an AI World
**Author:** Jeremy A. Rentz

**Key Contribution:** Addresses assessment design in the AI era by reframing the purpose of homework, emphasizing in-class assessments, and using alternative grading to focus on learning over performance.

**Relevance Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Summary:** Rentz builds on James Lang's research on why students cheat (high stakes, unclear purpose, low confidence, grades over growth) to design assessments that reduce AI misuse while promoting genuine learning. Key strategies: frequent low-stakes in-class exams (4-5 per semester), homework capped at 10-15% of grade as practice rather than performance, transparent explanation of assessment purposes, alternative grading (complete/incomplete) that destigmatizes revision, and process-based assignments focused on learning journey not just outcomes.

**Why Critical for A2I:** Technical courses face acute challenges with AI tools that can solve problems. This article provides practical assessment redesign strategies that ensure students actually learn rather than outsourcing to AI.

---

### Article 4: Rethinking the Flipped Classroom: Beyond Content Delivery
**Author:** Rachel Glazener

**Key Contribution:** Demonstrates how to implement effective flipped classroom pedagogy through metacognitive instruction and structured learning journals, with documented success (D/F/W rates cut by more than half).

**Relevance Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Summary:** Glazener's approach combines: pre-class video content for foundational knowledge, metacognitive training from day one (teaching students to recognize when they truly understand vs. merely recognize material), structured learning journals for reflection and accountability, and in-class time dedicated to collaborative problem-solving with instructor support. Key insight: "securing student buy-in" is the most time-intensive but critical aspect—students must understand WHY the flip structure benefits them.

**Why Critical for A2I:** Technical AI/ML courses involve complex conceptual material ideal for flipped formats. This article provides a proven implementation framework with measurable outcomes.

---

### Article 5: Teaching for Transformation: Strategies to Help Students See the World Differently
**Author:** Michelle Blank Rentz

**Key Contribution:** Applies Mezirow's transformative learning framework (condensed to 4 practical stages) and schema theory to guide how students integrate challenging new information.

**Relevance Score:** ⭐⭐⭐ **MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY**

**Summary:** Rentz describes using transformative learning to help students develop new mental schemas: (1) Disorienting dilemma - present information that challenges existing beliefs, (2) Critical reflection - guide analysis through strategic questioning, (3) Development/adjustment - students assimilate, adapt, or (rarely) reject new information, (4) Integration - transformed schemas produce new ways of thinking/acting. Emphasizes faculty role as "More Knowledgeable Other" (MKO) from Vygotsky's theory.

**Why Critical for A2I:** AI ethics and societal impact discussions require students to transform their thinking about technology, responsibility, and societal structures. This framework guides how to facilitate these difficult conversations.

## Appendix: Full Article Summaries

### Article 6: The DEI Debacle (Nimisha Barton)

While less directly applicable to curriculum pedagogy, this article provides important historical context on institutional responses to political pressure. Key insight: university leaders' capitulation to pressure on DEI offices mirrors 1970s responses to diversity initiatives. Relevant for A2I governance discussions about maintaining commitment to equity-centered AI education despite political headwinds.

**Limited Integration:** Primarily useful for leadership discussions, not classroom practice.

### Article 7: Helping Students Build a Life in the Age of AI (Jason Gulya)

Focuses on using AI tools to reduce student workload while maintaining learning integrity. Discusses process-based assignments and alternative grading that emphasize learning journey over final products. Complements Rentz's article on assessment design.

**Integration:** Supports the broader assessment redesign recommendations; less novel than other articles but reinforces key themes.
