# Coursera Delivery Model

## Purpose in the A²I Stack

Coursera scales the A²I narrative globally, offering asynchronous media, case studies, and auto-checks that feed directly into Canvas-led reflection and assessment. It ensures working professionals can engage flexibly while staying connected to the shared 8-week cadence.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L88】

## Content Strategy

- **Narrative Arcs:** Short-form modules introduce the coherence-first mindset, entrepreneurial stories, and governance provocations that later surface in Canvas discussions.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L124-L135】
- **Domain Spotlights:** Growth for Good, Finance for Inclusion, and Healthcare for Humanity playlists showcase partner challenges and mission-driven exemplars, priming elective work.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L114】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】
- **Entrepreneurship Threads:** Interviews with Origin Ventures, iVenture founders, and Gies faculty reinforce the venture pathway embedded in the curriculum.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L124-L135】

## Learning Flow

1. **Pre-Canvas Primer:** Learners complete Coursera missions before each Canvas sprint, unlocking auto-checks that test strategic framing, data readiness, and governance awareness.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L109】
2. **Reflexive Prompts:** Each video segment ends with “coherence questions” exported to Canvas for peer critique, ensuring asynchronous work fuels cyber-social dialogue.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
3. **Evidence Packs:** Completion analytics, quiz performance, and reflection snippets feed Canvas analytics and GitHub retros to inform faculty interventions.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】

## Integration Mechanics

- **LTI & Single Sign-On:** A²I learners access Coursera modules directly from Canvas, preserving a unified learner record across platforms.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L88】
- **Auto-Check Synchronization:** Coursera quiz outcomes pass to Canvas gradebook as formative signals, not summative grades, keeping faculty in control of evaluation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
- **GitHub Artifact Links:** Selected Coursera assignments push learners to publish reflections or lab notebooks in GitHub repositories, reinforcing open learning norms.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Coursera captions, translation layers, and downloadable transcripts support the land-grant mission of widening access. Domain playlists feature community partners from multiple regions to ensure diverse representation in case material.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L114】

## Quality & Governance

- Quarterly reviews align Coursera sequences with Canvas expectations, verifying that case studies, auto-checks, and labs still advance the founding principles of coherence, governance, and inclusion.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- New modules require GitHub issues that cite the relevant program thread (Access & Equity, Innovation & Research, Engagement & Economic Development, Leadership & Ethics) before production begins.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】
