# GitHub Open Development

## Why GitHub Matters

GitHub is the public memory of the A²I program. It documents curriculum evolution, governance debates, and learner artifacts so the community can hold itself accountable to the founding principles of coherence, inclusion, and reflexive learning.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

## Repository Architecture

- **`docs/`** – Curriculum, pedagogy, platform, governance, and entrepreneurship guides linked to conversation excerpts for provenance.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
- **`automation/`** – Actions like `ai_review.yml` and `curriculum_change_log.yml` enforce change visibility and AI-use declarations.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L184-L193】
- **Studio & Course Repos** – Each course (A²I 601–606, 621–623, 643, 699) maintains templates, rubrics, and sample artifacts under open licenses to encourage remixing and critique.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L94-L135】

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Issue First:** Contributors open issues referencing the relevant program thread (Access & Equity, Innovation & Research, Engagement & Economic Development, Leadership & Ethics).【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】
2. **Proposal Draft:** Pull requests include AI-use statements, impact rationale, and links to conversation lines that justify the change.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
3. **Peer & AI Review:** Maintainers and AI summarizers collaborate to ensure updates strengthen coherence rather than add disconnected capability.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L184-L193】
4. **Changelog Automation:** Upon merge, Actions update public logs so the broader community can trace curriculum evolution.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L184-L193】

## Learner Engagement

- **Project Artifacts:** Students push studio deliverables, evaluation harnesses, and governance dossiers to shared repos, modeling professional documentation habits.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L101-L135】
- **Peer Feedback:** PR reviews become structured critique spaces, supported by AI agents that summarize themes and flag unresolved questions before viva sessions.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
- **Public Reflection:** Capstone teams publish playbooks and venture briefs through GitHub Pages to contribute to the mission of widening access and economic development.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L116-L177】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】

## Governance & Trust

- **Transparency:** All governance policies, AI use guidelines, and risk registers live in version control, embodying governance-as-innovation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】
- **Accountability Rituals:** Monthly reviews analyze contribution diversity, response times, and inclusion metrics using repository analytics.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- **Community Norms:** The Code of Conduct and contribution guidelines align with UIUC and Gies expectations for respectful, mission-driven collaboration.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L60】

## Interface with Other Platforms

- **Canvas:** Gradebook automations trigger when PRs merge, capturing learning evidence in the LMS.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
- **Coursera:** Selected assignments direct learners to open issues or PRs, ensuring asynchronous study culminates in public artifacts.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
- **Google Cloud:** Infrastructure code, notebooks, and telemetry pipelines synchronize through GitHub Actions for reproducibility.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

GitHub keeps A²I accountable to its founding insight—*capability is cheap; coherence is scarce*—by making every improvement visible, reviewable, and grounded in shared mission.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L47】
