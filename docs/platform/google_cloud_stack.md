# Google Cloud Stack

## Strategic Role

Google Cloud furnishes the applied laboratories where learners orchestrate data pipelines, train and evaluate models, and deploy agentic workflows that embody the program’s commitment to coherence and governance.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】

## Core Services in Use

- **BigQuery & Looker:** Power analytics engineering, observability dashboards, and mission-aligned metrics required in studios and capstone work.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】
- **Vertex AI:** Hosts model training, prompt engineering, and evaluation harnesses for predictive, prescriptive, and agentic systems.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L101-L109】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L120-L135】
- **Cloud Run & Functions:** Enable rapid deployment of microservices that connect AI insights to operational workflows during studios.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L101-L109】
- **IAM & Cloud Logging:** Provide the governance backbone—role-based access, audit trails, and telemetry for the trust systems core course.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L100-L109】

## Learning Journeys

| Course | GCP Focus | Sample Deliverable |

| A²I 699 – Capstone | Systems integration or venture prototypes. | Production-ready stack with observability dashboards and governance dossier for partners.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L116-L177】 |

## Operational Practices

- **Project Provisioning:** Cohorts receive scoped GCP projects with budget caps, service catalog presets, and policy baselines to encourage responsible experimentation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】
- **Telemetry Pipelines:** Labs push logs and metrics to shared dashboards that faculty use during governance rituals to monitor risk and progress.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- **Open Artifacts:** Terraform templates, notebooks, and evaluation harnesses live in GitHub for transparency and reuse.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

## Inclusion & Access

UIUC’s access mission guides resource allocation—credits prioritize community-oriented projects, and alternative lightweight environments are offered for regions with bandwidth constraints.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】

## Governance Alignment

Regular reviews ensure GCP usage reflects governance-as-innovation: documenting decision trails, embedding accountability, and aligning with program threads on leadership, engagement, and equity.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
