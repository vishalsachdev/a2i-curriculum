# Canvas Integration Blueprint

## Role in the Delivery Stack

Canvas anchors the synchronous, graded, and community-governed elements of the 36-credit A²I program, providing the backbone for the shared 8-week course template described in the founding conversation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L88】

## 8-Week Module Template

| Week | Canvas Responsibilities | Connected Platforms |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 0 | Publish orientation, AI-use charter, and governance agreements; host kickoff forum. | GitHub for charter PRs, Coursera primer playlist.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】 |
| 1-4 | Manage discussion prompts, formative quizzes, and project checkpoints. | Coursera auto-checks, GCP lab links, GitHub issue trackers.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】 |
| 5-7 | Facilitate studio design reviews, governance triads, and peer critique cycles. | BigQuery/Vertex AI telemetry, GitHub review requests.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L100-L134】 |
| 8 | Schedule oral vivas, collect reflections, and release summative rubrics. | Viva transcripts to GitHub, impact briefs to stakeholders.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L120】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】 |

## Key Canvas Spaces

- **Modules:** Mirror the 8-week cadence with consistent structure to reduce cognitive load for working professionals.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L88】
- **Assignments:** Capture applied artifacts, viva recordings, and reflexive essays with rubrics emphasizing coherence, governance, and mission impact.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L82-L109】
- **Discussions:** Anchor cyber-social exchanges and cross-track critiques, ensuring access and inclusion remain visible program threads.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L163】
- **Analytics:** Surface participation, peer feedback flow, and risk alerts for faculty governance rituals.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】

## Integrations & Automations

- **LTI to Coursera:** Syncs playlists, assessments, and completion data so learners experience a seamless handoff between asynchronous content and Canvas-based reflection.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L88】
- **GCP Lab Launchers:** Deep links instantiate BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Looker labs directly from assignments, pre-configured with project scaffolds.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】
- **GitHub Webhooks:** Canvas gradebook entries trigger when PRs merge, reinforcing open documentation of learning evidence.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
- **AI Viva Recorder:** Speech-to-text capture and summarization feed governance dashboards while keeping humans in control of assessment.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Canvas course shells default to multi-modal content, captioned media, translation aids, and flexible deadlines to reflect UIUC’s land-grant commitment to widening participation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】 Weekly check-ins prompt faculty to review participation heatmaps and intervene where inclusion gaps appear.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】

## Governance Practices

- Changes to Canvas templates require a GitHub issue citing the relevant principle or mission alignment need, ensuring transparency in pedagogical evolution.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
- Monthly audits confirm assignments still assess coherence over capability and that viva protocols remain robust against emerging AI risks.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
