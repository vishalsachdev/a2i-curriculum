# Platform & Tools

> **📋 STATUS: Documentation Needed**
> This section is currently under development. We welcome contributions from the community!

## Overview

This directory will document the proposed technical infrastructure for delivering the A²I program, including:

- **Learning Management System** - Canvas LMS configuration and integration
- **Content Delivery** - Coursera platform integration for asynchronous media
- **Cloud Infrastructure** - Google Cloud Platform setup (BigQuery, Vertex AI, Looker)
- **Development & Collaboration** - GitHub workflows, automation, and open development
- **AI-Native Tools** - Personal learning assistants, automated feedback systems
- **Accessibility & Global Reach** - Mobile optimization, offline capabilities, multi-language support

## Current Status

As noted in the main [README](../../README.md), platform selections would be finalized upon program approval based on institutional resources and partnerships.

Preliminary infrastructure considerations are outlined in:
- [Curriculum Overview](../curriculum/overview.md) - Proposed delivery infrastructure
- [Online Delivery Model](../online-delivery/) - Detailed implementation specifications

## How to Contribute

We invite contributions in the following areas:

1. **Platform Architecture** - Technical infrastructure design and integration patterns
2. **Tool Evaluations** - Comparative analysis of learning technologies
3. **Implementation Guides** - Setup instructions and best practices
4. **Automation Workflows** - GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines
5. **Accessibility Standards** - WCAG compliance and inclusive design
6. **Cost Analysis** - Budget considerations and resource planning

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on contributing to this proposal.

## Suggested Documentation Structure

Future documentation in this directory might include:

- `canvas-lms.md` - Canvas configuration, course templates, assessment design
- `coursera-integration.md` - Content delivery, media production, learner analytics
- `google-cloud.md` - GCP environment setup, lab infrastructure, data governance
- `github-workflows.md` - Automation, CI/CD, open development practices
- `ai-tools.md` - Learning assistants, feedback systems, intelligent matching
- `accessibility.md` - Mobile optimization, offline access, multi-language support
- `security-privacy.md` - Data protection, FERPA compliance, access control
