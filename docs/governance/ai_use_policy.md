# AI Use Policy

## Intent

The A²I program positions AI as a cognitive partner. This policy ensures learners leverage intelligent tools transparently while preserving human judgment, mission alignment, and governance rigor.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】

## Disclosure Requirements

1. **Week 0 Declaration:** Every learner submits an AI-use charter in Canvas outlining approved tools, safeguards, and accountability partners. Declarations are version-controlled in GitHub.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
2. **Artifact Statements:** Each submission includes an AI contribution note describing prompts, iterations, and human oversight, reinforcing reflexive practice.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
3. **Peer Accountability:** Studio teams review one another’s declarations during governance triads to ensure consistent interpretation of policy expectations.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L100-L135】

## Permitted Use

- **Ideation & Synthesis:** Brainstorming, summarizing research, and generating stakeholder scenarios when humans verify accuracy.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
- **Feedback & Evaluation:** Draft critiques, code review suggestions, and observability alerts that humans interpret and act upon.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
- **Accessibility Support:** Translation, captioning, and alternative format generation to uphold access and inclusion commitments.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】

## Prohibited Use

- **Undisclosed Automation:** Submitting AI-generated work without acknowledgement or misrepresenting agent contributions violates academic integrity.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
- **Delegated Judgment:** Allowing AI to make final grading, governance, or stakeholder commitments without human oversight undermines program principles.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】
- **Bias Amplification:** Deploying AI outputs that degrade access, equity, or mission alignment without remediation is prohibited.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】

## Review & Enforcement

- **Monitoring:** AI logs, Canvas analytics, and GitHub histories inform monthly governance reviews to surface policy drift or equity concerns.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- **Incident Response:** Potential violations trigger the academic integrity workflow, emphasizing restorative action and transparency.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- **Policy Updates:** Changes to approved tools or guardrails require an issue citing conversation references and mission impact before approval.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

## Support

- **Tool Clinics:** Faculty and mentors host sessions on prompt design, evaluation heuristics, and bias mitigation to deepen AI literacy.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- **Resource Library:** The repository aggregates exemplars of disclosure statements, governance scorecards, and evaluation harnesses to guide responsible use.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

This policy keeps AI participation aligned with A²I’s vision of producing system orchestrators who can wield intelligence responsibly for public value.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】
