# Data Privacy & Stewardship

## Principle

Data stewardship in A²I is part of training system orchestrators who can protect communities while delivering intelligent services. Privacy practices must align with the program’s commitment to access, inclusion, and governance innovation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】

## Stewardship Framework

| Layer | Expectations | Conversation Anchor |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Collection** | Gather only mission-aligned data, disclose provenance, and document consent pathways, especially for community and public sector partners. | A²I’s purpose is to expand opportunity and public value through trustworthy systems.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L60】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】 |
| **Storage** | Use Google Cloud projects with predefined IAM roles, encryption defaults, and logging. Sensitive data remains in segmented datasets with access justified in Canvas governance notes. | Governance-as-innovation and GCP stack commitments.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】 |
| **Use** | Employ data only for the articulated mission outcome; integrate fairness checks and differential impact analysis before deployment. | Evidence and causality emphasis in core curriculum.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L94-L114】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】 |
| **Sharing** | Publish anonymized artifacts via GitHub with clear licenses, or restricted partner reports when obligations require. Maintain audit trails of who accessed what, when, and why. | Open development ethos with accountability.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】 |

## Learner Responsibilities

- **Privacy Impact Notes:** Each project submission includes a one-page privacy impact statement outlining data categories, retention, and mitigation strategies.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L100-L109】
- **Access Reviews:** Studio teams rotate stewardship roles to review IAM policies, ensuring inclusion goals are met without exposing sensitive information.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L114】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】
- **Incident Reporting:** Suspected breaches or misuses are logged via GitHub issues within 24 hours and escalated to faculty governance leads.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

## Faculty & Partner Responsibilities

- **Data Agreements:** Prior to project launch, faculty confirm legal, ethical, and community consent alignment, referencing UIUC mission commitments.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L60】
- **Observability Dashboards:** Mentors maintain dashboards tracking data access patterns, bias metrics, and retention timelines for monthly governance reviews.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- **Sunset Protocols:** At project completion, data is archived or deleted per agreements, and learners publish a closure note documenting outcomes and learnings.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】

Data privacy is foundational to demonstrating that intelligent systems can expand opportunity without compromising the communities they serve.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】
