# Academic Integrity & Coherence Standards

## Purpose

Academic integrity within A²I is inseparable from the program’s demand for coherent, mission-aligned systems. Learners must document how humans, data, and agents collaborate, ensuring honesty about contributions, limitations, and risks.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】

## Core Commitments

1. **Transparent Authorship:** Every submission—projects, vivas, code, venture briefs—includes an AI-use declaration and collaborator log stored in GitHub.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
2. **Evidence Integrity:** Data sources, evaluation methods, and observability metrics must be auditable. Fabrication erodes the governance-as-innovation ethos and triggers remediation or disciplinary review.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L100-L109】
3. **Mission Alignment:** Work must align with UIUC’s access mission and the program’s domain tracks; artifacts that undermine equity or trust are revised or rejected.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L163】

## Expectations by Learning Mode

| Context | Integrity Expectations | Examples |
|---------|-----------------------|----------|
| **Canvas Discussions** | Cite conversation excerpts, partner materials, and AI assistance. Challenge ideas respectfully, foregrounding UIUC and Gies values.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L60】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】 | Annotated discussion posts, AI-generated summaries with disclosure notes. |
| **Studios & Labs** | Maintain reproducible pipelines, commit histories, and governance checklists. Peer review includes integrity spot-checks.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L101-L135】 | BigQuery lineage scripts, Vertex AI experiment logs, PR reviews confirming original work. |
| **Capstone & Ventures** | Publish stakeholder charters, risk registers, and viva transcripts. Misrepresentation of partnerships or metrics violates academic integrity and venture ethics.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L116-L177】 | Public-facing whitepapers, diligence packets validated by mentors. |

## Handling Violations

1. **Issue Filing:** Suspected violations generate a GitHub issue tagged with the relevant program thread and governance label.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
2. **Review Panel:** Faculty, governance coaches, and when appropriate partner representatives examine evidence, including AI logs and viva recordings.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
3. **Restorative Actions:** Outcomes focus on restoring coherence—revisions, public errata, or additional governance training—before escalating to formal sanctions when intent to deceive is clear.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】

## Support & Education

- **Week 0 Orientation:** Canvas hosts workshops on responsible AI, open scholarship, and disclosure expectations.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】
- **Mentor Clinics:** Studios include integrity checkpoints to model professional ethics in analytics, finance, and healthcare domains.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L114】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L163】
- **Resource Library:** GitHub maintains templates for attribution, data provenance, and viva documentation so learners can comply confidently.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

Academic integrity in A²I is not just compliance—it is how we sustain trust in the systems we deploy for public value.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】
