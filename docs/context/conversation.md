# Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Business Systems (A²I)

## 1. Program Origin and Vision

**Goal:**  
Design a 36-credit, online, asynchronous master’s program for working professionals, hosted via Coursera and Canvas, integrating Google Cloud and reflexive AI pedagogy.

**Premise:**  
As AI and agents can now perform most knowledge work, universities must train *system orchestrators* — professionals who frame, verify, and align intelligent systems for business and societal value.

**Core Purpose:**  
> “Capability is cheap; coherence is scarce.”  
> A²I teaches students to design, govern, and lead intelligent systems that align human judgment, data, and automation.

---

## 2. Foundational Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Coherence over capability** | Graduates learn to coordinate AI systems and people into workflows that deliver verifiable value. |
| **Organizational literacy** | Focus on workflow, data quality, and cross-functional coordination, not narrow tool fluency. |
| **Governance as innovation** | Trust, accountability, and observability are treated as design opportunities. |
| **Access & Inclusion** | Reflecting UIUC’s land-grant mission and Gies’s belief in access and diversity. |

---

## 3. Institutional Alignment

**UIUC Mission:**  
Enhance lives through learning, discovery, engagement, and economic development.

**Gies Vision:**  
Shape purposeful leaders through life-changing access to education, research, and innovation.

**Program Response:**  
A²I fuses applied AI with purposeful leadership. Students learn to use intelligent systems to expand opportunity, strengthen organizations, and create economic and social value.

---

## 4. Program Architecture

### Delivery Model
- **Coursera** – scalable asynchronous content.  
- **Canvas** – rigorous live elements, grading, peer reviews.  
- **Google Cloud** – hands-on labs using BigQuery, Vertex AI, Looker.  
- **GitHub** – open development repository (`a2i-curriculum`) for transparency and iteration.

### Structure
- **12 courses / 36 credits / 8-week terms**
- Core, Labs, Electives, and Capstone
- Global, asynchronous, designed for working professionals

### Learning Design
Each course follows an **8-week Canvas template**:
- Week 0: Orientation + AI-use policy  
- Weeks 1-8: Coursera videos, readings, auto-checks, applied assignments, peer discussion, oral viva  
- Week 8: Final project submission + reflection viva  

Assessments weight:
| Category | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Applied projects | 50% |
| Auto-checks | 20% |
| Oral viva | 20% |
| Peer critique | 10% |

## 5. Curriculum Overview

### Foundations
| Code | Course | Focus |
|------|---------|-------|
| A²I 601 | AI Strategy & Problem Framing | Framing AI for business and societal value |
| A²I 602 | Data & AI Infrastructure | Inclusive, ethical data systems |
| A²I 603 | Evidence & Causality | Experimental design and fairness |
| A²I 604 | Predictive & Prescriptive AI | Optimization for sustainable value |
| A²I 605 | Intelligent Agents & Workflows | Automation, augmentation, and human-AI collaboration |
| A²I 606 | Governance & Trust Systems | Ethics, regulation, accountability |

### Studios (Labs)
| Code | Lab | Outcome |
|------|-----|----------|
| A²I 621 | Analytics Engineering Studio | Data pipeline design on GCP |
| A²I 622 | Data Product Studio | Build deployable AI products |
| A²I 623 | Agent Ops & Evaluation Studio | Evaluate agents for reliability, safety, and coherence |

### Domain Tracks
- **Growth for Good** – ethical marketing and experimentation  
- **Finance for Inclusion** – AI for equitable financial systems  
- **Healthcare for Humanity** – analytics for access and outcomes  

### Capstone
**A²I 699: Intelligent Systems for Public Value**  
Two tracks:
1. **Systems Integration Project** – applied AI solution for an organization.  
2. **Venture Launch Project** – startup-style capstone leveraging the Gies iVenture Accelerator.

---

## 6. Entrepreneurship Integration

**Based on Gies’s Entrepreneurship Ecosystem:**
- Origin Ventures Office of Entrepreneurship  
- iVenture Accelerator (seed funding, mentorship)  
- Strategy, Innovation & Entrepreneurship programs

**A²I Enhancements:**
- New elective: *A²I 643 – Venture Creation in Intelligent Systems*  
- Capstone venture path supported by iVenture  
- Entrepreneurial modules in core courses (AI opportunity recognition, lean startup, funding models)  
- Emphasis on innovation, startup ecosystems, and AI commercialization

---

## 7. Reflexive Pedagogy and AI Integration

**Critique of LMS Platformization:**  
Conventional LMSs reproduce didactic, top-down pedagogy. They measure compliance, not cognition.

**Reflexive Model (inspired by CGScholar):**
- Peer-to-peer creation, social learning, continuous feedback.  
- Focus on *ergative outcomes* — what students *make* to demonstrate learning.  
- AI as *cognitive prosthesis*: feedback partner, not cheating threat.  

**Cyber-Social Learning Design:**
- Human ↔ AI ↔ Peer feedback loops.  
- Transparent analytics dashboards shared with learners.  
- Formative evaluation over summative grading.

---

## 8. Program Threads (Mission-Driven Themes)

| Thread | Description | Alignment |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Access & Equity** | Widen participation, reduce bias | UIUC public mission |
| **Innovation & Research** | Reflexive labs and open GitHub repo | Gies innovation ethos |
| **Engagement & Economic Development** | Capstones tied to Illinois Innovation Network & global partners | Land-grant purpose |
| **Leadership & Ethics** | Continuous reflection on “What kind of world am I building?” | Gies purposeful leadership |
