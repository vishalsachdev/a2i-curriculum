# Learning Pod Structure for Online Delivery

## Overview

Learning pods are small, intimate cohorts of 4-5 students that provide the human connection and accountability essential for online learning success. These pods serve as the primary community unit within the larger cohort, creating a sustainable support system that scales effectively across global, asynchronous programs.

## Pod Formation

### Formation Process

**Week 0: Pre-Course Survey**

The pod matching system uses several criteria to form optimal learning groups:

**Required Criteria:**
- Minimum 4 hours of timezone overlap between members
- At least 2 common time slots for potential meetings
- Similar commitment level expectations for the course

**Preferred Criteria:**
- Diversity across different industry sectors
- Complementary skill sets and varied professional backgrounds
- Mix of different learning style preferences

**Optional Considerations:**
- Shared language preferences for easier communication
- Mixed levels of prior experience to enable peer teaching
- Aligned career goals and interests for motivation

### AI-Powered Matching Algorithm

The pod matching algorithm is designed to work with cohorts of approximately 100 students, forming optimal groups of 5 members each. The system considers multiple constraints during the matching process:

**Key Constraint Factors:**
- Timezone compatibility calculations to ensure reasonable overlap
- Skill diversity assessment to create balanced learning environments
- Schedule matching to find common availability windows
- Personality balance to create harmonious team dynamics

**Pod Formation Process:**
The algorithm builds a compatibility matrix comparing all students, then optimizes pod assignments to maximize both compatibility and diversity. After initial assignment, the system validates and adjusts pods as needed to ensure quality.

**Pod Health Monitoring:**
The system continuously tracks pod health across multiple dimensions:
- Hours of timezone overlap between members
- Variance in skill levels and specializations
- Equity in participation and engagement levels
- Member satisfaction scores from regular surveys

### Self-Selection Option

Students may opt to form their own pods if they have existing relationships or specific preferences.

**Self-Selected Pod Requirements:**
1. Must have 4-5 members
2. Must complete Pod Charter together
3. Must commit to full 8-week duration
4. Must designate Pod Captain role
5. Must meet timezone overlap requirements

## Pod Structure and Roles

### Rotating Roles (Weekly)

| Role | Responsibilities | Time Commitment |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Pod Captain** | Schedule meetings, track attendance, submit weekly report | 2 hours/week |
| **Note Taker** | Document discussions, maintain shared resources | 1.5 hours/week |
| **Facilitator** | Lead discussions, manage agenda | 1.5 hours/week |
| **Connector** | Liaise with other pods, find resources | 1 hour/week |
| **Encourager** | Check on absent members, celebrate wins | 1 hour/week |

### Pod Charter Template

Each pod creates a charter document that includes the following sections:

**Mission Statement:** Articulates why the pod members are learning together and their shared purpose.

**Meeting Schedule:** Specifies the weekly sync time (day, time, and duration), frequency of async check-ins, and process for emergency support situations.

**Communication Norms:** Defines the primary communication platform, expected response times, and meeting attendance policies.

**Learning Goals:** Lists shared goals for the entire pod (typically 2-3), plus space for individual members' personal learning objectives.

**Accountability Agreements:** Establishes clear expectations for handling missed meetings, resolving conflicts, and supporting members who are struggling.

**Success Metrics:** Defines how the pod will measure its success and what milestones will be celebrated along the way.

**Signatures:** All pod members digitally sign and date the charter to formalize their commitment.
