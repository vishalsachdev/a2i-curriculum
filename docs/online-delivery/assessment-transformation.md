# Assessment Transformation for Online Delivery

## Overview

Traditional assessment methods designed for in-person delivery must be fundamentally reimagined for online, asynchronous environments. This transformation prioritizes authentic assessment, continuous evaluation, and workplace application.

## Assessment Framework

### Original vs. Adapted Assessment Structure

| Team Projects | 30% | Federated Individual Projects | 25% |
| Written Assignments | 25% | Portfolio-Based Assessment | 35% |
| Class Participation | 15% | Digital Engagement Metrics | 10% |
| Peer Reviews | 10% | Workplace Verification | 15% |

## Detailed Assessment Components

### 1. Asynchronous Video Presentations (15%)

**Format:**
- 10-15 minute recorded presentations
- Submitted via Canvas Studio or YouTube
- AI-generated questions based on content
- Peer review component (5%)

**Rubric:**
- Technical Accuracy (30%)
- Communication Clarity (25%)
- Critical Analysis (25%)
- Visual Design (10%)
- Time Management (10%)

**Tools:**
- Loom for screen recording
- Canvas Studio for submission
- Peer Review via Canvas
- AI feedback via custom GPT

### 2. Federated Individual Projects (25%)

**Structure:**
- Individual components with defined APIs
- GitHub-based collaboration
- Continuous integration testing
- Weekly progress commits

**Example Project Architecture:**

The federated project structure organizes individual contributions within a collaborative repository:
- **Main Project Repository:** Root directory
  - **Student Module Directories:** Individual student components (e.g., student-1-module, student-2-module)
    - Source code (src/)
    - Unit tests (tests/)
    - API documentation (API.md)
  - **Integration Directory:** Cross-module integration tests
  - **Documentation Directory:** Shared project documentation

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Code Quality (30%)
- API Design (20%)
- Documentation (20%)
- Integration Success (20%)
- Innovation (10%)

### 3. Portfolio-Based Assessment (35%)

**Components:**
- GitHub Repository Activity (10%)
- Weekly Reflection Journals (10%)
- Applied Work Projects (10%)
- Peer Code Reviews (5%)

**Portfolio Structure:**

Each student maintains a comprehensive portfolio organized as follows:
- **Weekly Reflections:** Individual markdown files for each week's learning reflections
- **Projects:** Separate directories for each project including the capstone
- **Code Reviews:**
  - Given: Reviews provided to peers
  - Received: Reviews received from others
- **Workplace Applications:**
  - Problem statements: Documented workplace challenges
  - Solutions: Implemented solutions and outcomes

**Continuous Assessment Model:**
- Weekly commits required (minimum 3)
- Bi-weekly portfolio reviews
- AI-powered plagiarism detection
- Peer verification system

### 4. Digital Engagement Metrics (10%)

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Forum Participation (quality over quantity)
- Peer Support Activities
- Resource Sharing
- Virtual Event Attendance (optional but credited)

**Engagement Scoring:**

The digital engagement score is calculated using a weighted formula combining:
- Forum quality score: 40% weight (based on thoughtfulness and contribution value)
- Peer support score: 30% weight (help provided to other students)
- Resource sharing score: 20% weight (useful materials shared with cohort)
- Event participation bonus: 10% weight (optional live event attendance)

### 5. Workplace Verification (15%)

**Process:**
1. Student identifies workplace challenge
2. Applies course concepts to solve
3. Manager provides verification letter
4. Student presents outcomes

**Verification Template:**

The workplace application verification form includes:

**Header Information:**
- Student name
- Project title
- Organization name
- Supervisor name and title

**Content Sections:**

**Problem Statement:** Clear description of the organizational challenge addressed

**Solution Applied:** Detailed explanation of how the student applied course concepts to solve the problem

**Measurable Outcomes:** Three specific outcomes with quantifiable metrics demonstrating impact

**Verification Statement:** Supervisor confirms the project was completed by the student and validates the stated organizational impact, including digital signature and date

## Academic Integrity in Online Assessment

### Proctoring Strategy
- **No Traditional Proctoring:** Focus on authentic assessment
- **Open-Book Policy:** All assessments assume resource access
- **Plagiarism Detection:** Turnitin + Code similarity analysis
- **Honor Code:** Digital signature on all submissions

### AI Use Policy for Assessments

**Permitted AI Use:**
- Debugging assistance to identify and fix code errors
- Concept clarification for better understanding
- Code review suggestions for improvement
- Grammar and style checking for written work

**Prohibited AI Use:**
- Complete solution generation without student work
- Direct assignment completion by AI
- Impersonation in video presentations
- Automated peer review generation
