## Phase 4 – Continuous Innovation (Months 25+)

- Launch public research on reflexive pedagogy, cyber-social learning, and AI governance practices derived from program data.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L152】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
- Scale venture ecosystem with additional funding partnerships and Origin Ventures/iVenture-aligned accelerators.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L124-L135】

## Success Metrics

| Theme | Indicator |
|-------|-----------|
| **Coherence** | Percentage of courses demonstrating clear alignment between strategy, evidence, infrastructure, and governance deliverables.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L109】 |
| **Inclusion** | Representation of underserved learners in domain tracks and venture residencies; accessibility compliance across platforms.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】 |
| **Entrepreneurship** | Number of ventures/incubations progressing to capstone launch with documented public value outcomes.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L116-L135】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】 |
| **Governance** | Frequency and quality of governance ritual outputs, including AI-use audits and data stewardship reports.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】 |
