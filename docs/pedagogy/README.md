# Pedagogy Overview

## Purpose
The A²I curriculum treats pedagogy itself as a living system—continuously reflexive, cyber-social, and AI-augmented.  
Each model in this folder defines one facet of how learners, faculty, and intelligent tools co-create coherence.

> “Capability is cheap; coherence is scarce.”  
> Learning here means widening the bandwidth between empowerment and plasticity.

## Core Pedagogical Models

### 1. Reflexive Learning Model
Learners interrogate the sociotechnical systems they build rather than consuming static content.  
Courses emphasize **ergative outcomes**—what students *make*—and replace compliance grading with oral vivas, retrospectives, and public artifacts.  
Faculty act as *Socratic guides*, *governance coaches*, and *entrepreneurial catalysts*.

### 2. Cyber-Social Learning
Education unfolds through a triad of **human ↔ AI ↔ peer** exchanges.  
Studios and discussions operate as open systems where agents summarize feedback, peers critique across tracks, and governance dashboards track inclusion and trust.  
Canvas, Coursera, Google Cloud, and GitHub form the shared infrastructure for these rituals.  
→ See [`cyber_social_learning.md`](cyber_social_learning.md)

### 3. AI Feedback and Assessment
Assessment exists to **increase coherence**, not surveillance.  
AI agents synthesize evidence, flag coherence gaps, and surface equity risks; faculty make the final judgments.  
The 8-week course template aligns assessment with reflexivity:
- Weeks 0–4: formative analytics and feedback bots  
- Weeks 5–7: studio evaluation harnesses  
- Week 8: viva intelligence packets and reflection loops

### 4. Empowerment ↔ Plasticity Framework
A²I pedagogy is grounded in the information-theoretic symmetry between **empowerment** (students shaping intelligent systems) and **plasticity** (students being shaped by reflection).  
Each course alternates between action and adaptation, expanding the program’s *coherence bandwidth*—the shared understanding between humans, data, and AI.

## Faculty & Governance
- **Governance-as-Design:** trust, observability, and accountability are treated as creative constraints.  
- **Reflexive Review:** monthly governance rituals assess whether coursework still embodies the founding vision.  
- **Open Development:** pedagogy files live in this repository for transparency and community contribution.

## How to Contribute
Faculty, students, and partners can propose updates through pull requests:
1. Reference the principle or file being extended.  
2. Provide a rationale linked to learning outcomes or governance data.  
3. Include examples or updated prompts where applicable.  

All pedagogical contributions are reviewed via AI-assisted PR summaries and community feedback to preserve reflexive integrity.
