# AI Feedback and Assessment

## Overview

AI-augmented feedback and assessment provide timely, personalized support while maintaining academic rigor and human oversight.

## Principles

### 1. AI as Complement, Not Replacement

- AI supports, not substitutes, human judgment
- Faculty oversight of all summative assessment
- AI handles routine feedback, humans handle complex evaluation
- Transparent about AI role

### 2. Timely and Personalized

- Immediate feedback on practice exercises
- Customized to individual learning needs
- Multiple attempts encouraged
- Learning-focused rather than grade-focused

### 3. Formative Focus

- Emphasis on learning and improvement
- Low-stakes practice with AI feedback
- High-stakes assessment with human review
- Growth over time tracked
