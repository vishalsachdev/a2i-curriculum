Cyber-social learning combines digital technologies with social learning theory to create rich, collaborative learning experiences.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Social Learning Theory

Building on Bandura and Vygotsky:
- Learning as social process
- Knowledge co-construction
- Communities of practice
- Zone of proximal development

### Digital Enhancement

Technology amplifies social learning:
- Global collaboration
- Asynchronous and synchronous interaction
- Diverse perspectives
- Persistent knowledge artifacts

## Implementation
