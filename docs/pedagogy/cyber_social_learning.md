# Cyber-Social Learning

## Framing

A²I operationalizes cyber-social learning as a triad of **human ↔ AI ↔ peer** exchanges that keep expertise, agency, and accountability distributed across the learning community.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L145-L152】 This orientation turns the program into a living system rather than a static content library.

## Core Patterns

| Pattern | What It Looks Like | Anchoring Conversation Insight |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Peer-to-Peer Knowledge Creation** | Studios publish working notes, run cross-track critiques, and maintain shared observability dashboards. | “Peer-to-peer creation, social learning, continuous feedback” underpins the reflexive model.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L144-L152】 |
| **AI-Augmented Feedback Loops** | Large language models summarize sprint reviews, flag coherence gaps, and suggest stakeholder questions before viva sessions. | AI is cast as a cognitive partner that amplifies reflection rather than policing compliance.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L145-L152】 |
| **Open Artifact Commons** | GitHub repos capture Canvas prompts, Coursera assets, studio retros, and governance decisions in the open. | Transparency and open development are foundational to the repository strategy.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】 |

## Platform Responsibilities

- **Canvas** coordinates synchronous critique rituals and oral vivas, ensuring every learner both gives and receives targeted feedback each week.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】
- **Coursera** provides the shared narrative spine—short cases, interviews, and provocations that fuel critique conversations across time zones.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L88】
- **Google Cloud** hosts collaborative notebooks, evaluation harnesses, and telemetry pipelines so teams can interrogate their systems together.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】
- **GitHub** records design rationales, issue debates, and PR histories to model professional collaboration habits.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】

## Rituals by Week

| Week | Cyber-Social Focus | Evidence |
|------|--------------------|----------|
| 0 | Shared AI-use agreements and community commitments drafted in Canvas discussions. | Signed pledges and summary memo archived in GitHub.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】 |
| 1-2 | Cross-cohort critique circles unpack stakeholder narratives and mission objectives. | Annotated Coursera transcripts, Miro canvases, and issue threads.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L112】 |
| 3-4 | Studio squads exchange evaluation harnesses and counterfactual analyses across domain tracks. | BigQuery notebooks, Vertex AI experiments, and peer review rubrics.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L101-L109】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L112-L135】 |
| 5-6 | Governance triads stress-test observability plans, bias checks, and escalation protocols. | Recorded viva rehearsals, governance scorecards, and policy playbooks.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L100-L134】 |
| 7-8 | Public showcase and viva reflections capture collective learning and future commitments. | GitHub Pages portfolios, Canvas viva transcripts, post-mortem dashboards.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L120】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L135-L177】 |

## Inclusive Practices

Cyber-social learning is inseparable from A²I’s commitment to access and equity. Faculty facilitate asynchronous participation windows, AI-generated translation, and rotating leadership roles so distributed learners—especially in Growth for Good, Finance for Inclusion, and Healthcare for Humanity tracks—can contribute fully.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L111-L114】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L156-L163】

## Governance Touchpoints

Each collaboration ritual feeds governance dashboards that track contribution diversity, review cadence, and risk signals. Program leaders review the data in monthly rituals to ensure the cyber-social fabric continues to widen participation and strengthen trust in line with the founding conversation.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】
