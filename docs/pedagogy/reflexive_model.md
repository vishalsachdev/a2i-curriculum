# Reflexive Learning Model

## Why Reflexivity Anchors A²I

The A²I program rejects compliance-driven e-learning in favor of a reflexive model where learners interrogate the sociotechnical systems they build. The founding conversation calls out how conventional LMS platforms over-index on surveillance metrics instead of cognition, pushing us to create spaces where students surface their own judgment and values.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L139-L154】

## Design Commitments

1. **Ergative Outcomes First** – Every module culminates in artifacts that show what learners *make*, not just what they recall. Project briefs, playbooks, dashboards, and viva recordings live in public or partner-facing repositories to demonstrate applied impact.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L141-L147】
2. **Reflection as Assessment** – Week 8 oral vivas and iterative retros become primary evidence of understanding, requiring learners to narrate their design decisions, governance trade-offs, and ethical stance.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】
3. **AI as Cognitive Prosthesis** – Intelligent agents critique drafts, surface counterfactuals, and synthesize peer feedback so humans can focus on meaning-making rather than compliance policing.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L145-L152】
4. **Governance-as-Design** – Learners practice embedding trust signals, observability, and accountability into every artifact, treating governance as a creative constraint rather than an afterthought.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L100-L109】

## Reflexive Learning Cycle

| Stage | Learner Moves | Platform Support |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Sense** | Surface assumptions about missions, stakeholders, and data realities. | Curated conversation excerpts, Canvas prompts, Coursera case mini-lectures.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L88】 |
| **Design** | Prototype workflows that align humans, data, and agents. | GCP sandboxes, GitHub issues, AI design partners.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L65-L109】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L149-L152】 |
| **Evidence** | Gather causal and experiential evidence of impact and risk. | Studio evaluation harnesses, peer critique rituals, reflexive analytics.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L101-L114】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L144-L152】 |
| **Reflect** | Host vivas, publish public artifacts, iterate governance plans. | Canvas viva rooms, GitHub Pages showcases, Origin Ventures mentorship.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L134】 |

The cycle repeats weekly across the 8-week template so learners experience continual feedback and revision rather than end-of-term judgment.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L76-L88】

## Faculty & Mentor Roles

- **Socratic Guides:** Faculty use the conversation archive as a living text, asking learners to situate work inside A²I principles and UIUC’s mission.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L60】
- **Governance Coaches:** Mentors stress observability, risk posture, and community accountability in every review.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L39-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L120-L155】
- **Entrepreneurial Catalysts:** Advisors connect reflexive insights to venture or systems integration pathways articulated in the capstone tracks.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L116-L135】

## Continuous Program Reflection

Monthly governance rituals examine whether coursework still embodies the founding vision—*capability is cheap; coherence is scarce*—and whether new tools or practices enhance coherence for learners and communities.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L27-L47】【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L214-L230】 When misalignment appears, faculty log issues in GitHub and coordinate fixes through open pull requests so the reflexive ethos guides the curriculum itself.【F:docs/context/conversation.md†L167-L193】
