# Reflexive Learning Model

## Overview

The reflexive learning model is a core pedagogical approach in the A2I curriculum, emphasizing continuous reflection, adaptation, and meta-learning.

## Key Principles

### 1. Reflection as Learning

Students are encouraged to:
- Reflect on their learning process
- Identify strengths and areas for improvement
- Connect new knowledge to prior understanding
- Consider multiple perspectives

### 2. Adaptive Learning Paths

The curriculum supports:
- Personalized learning trajectories
- Flexible pacing
- Choice in projects and topics
- Responsive to individual needs

### 3. Meta-Learning

Students develop:
- Awareness of their own learning strategies
- Ability to learn how to learn
- Self-regulation skills
- Growth mindset

## Implementation

### Reflection Activities

1. **Learning Journals**: Regular written reflections on learning experiences
2. **Peer Discussions**: Collaborative reflection sessions
3. **Project Retrospectives**: Analysis of project outcomes and processes
4. **Portfolio Reviews**: Curated collections of work with reflective commentary

### AI-Enhanced Reflection

AI tools support reflection by:
- Prompting reflective questions
- Analyzing learning patterns
- Suggesting areas for deeper exploration
- Providing personalized feedback

### Assessment Integration

Reflection is integrated into assessment:
- Self-assessment components
- Reflective essays and reports
- Process documentation
- Learning goal setting and review

## Benefits

The reflexive approach:
- Deepens understanding
- Promotes autonomous learning
- Develops critical thinking
- Prepares for lifelong learning
- Enhances transfer of knowledge

## Research Foundation

This model draws on:
- Schön's reflective practitioner
- Kolb's experiential learning cycle
- Metacognitive learning theory
- Self-regulated learning research

## Continuous Improvement

The reflexive model applies to the curriculum itself:
- Regular curriculum review
- Student feedback integration
- Faculty reflection on teaching
- Iterative refinement
