# Business Coherence Scorecard

## Purpose

The Business Coherence Scorecard operationalizes the A²I program's core insight—*capability is cheap; coherence is scarce*—into measurable business metrics that students use throughout their learning journey. This tool translates abstract coherence concepts into established business frameworks familiar to practitioners and executives, providing a structured approach to evaluating AI initiative maturity and alignment.

## Scorecard Framework

The scorecard assesses five dimensions of coherence using standard business assessment methods. Students complete baseline assessments at program entry, track progress through each course, and demonstrate measurable improvement in capstone projects.

## Five Coherence Dimensions

### 1. Strategic Alignment
**Business Question:** How well do AI initiatives map to organizational strategic objectives?

| Maturity Level | Score | Description | Assessment Method |
|---------------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **1 - Ad Hoc** | 0-20 | AI projects emerge opportunistically without strategic rationale | Balanced Scorecard Gap Analysis |
| **2 - Emerging** | 21-40 | Some AI initiatives reference strategic goals but linkage is loose | Strategy Map Exercise |
| **3 - Defined** | 41-60 | Clear mapping between AI portfolio and strategic objectives | OKR Alignment Matrix |
| **4 - Managed** | 61-80 | AI roadmap actively shaped by and shapes strategic planning | Portfolio Review Process |
| **5 - Optimizing** | 81-100 | Dynamic coherence between strategy evolution and AI capabilities | Real-time Strategic Dashboard |

**Key Metrics:**
- % of AI projects with documented strategic objective linkage
- Strategic goal coverage by AI portfolio (which goals lack AI support?)
- Investment alignment (% of AI budget supporting top 3 strategic priorities)
- Executive stakeholder engagement score (1-5 scale)

**Assessment Tool:** Balanced Scorecard Integration Worksheet

- Portfolio ROI (blended return across investment categories)
- Learning capture (% of failed experiments generating reusable insights)

**Assessment Tool:** Stage-Gate Evaluation with Three Horizons Model

## Overall Coherence Score

The overall coherence score is calculated as a weighted average:

```
Coherence Score = 
  (Strategic Alignment × 0.25) +
  (Operational Efficiency × 0.20) +
  (Stakeholder Value × 0.25) +
  (Risk Management × 0.15) +
  (Innovation Pipeline × 0.15)
```

### Score Interpretation

| Overall Score | Coherence Level | Business Readiness |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0-20 | **Incoherent** | High risk of AI initiative failure; fundamental restructuring needed |
| 21-40 | **Fragmented** | Siloed efforts; requires integration planning |
| 41-60 | **Emerging** | Foundation in place; needs systematic improvement |
| 61-80 | **Coherent** | Well-integrated AI program; ready for scaling |
| 81-100 | **Orchestrated** | Best-in-class AI orchestration; competitive advantage |

## Alignment with Program Vision

The Business Coherence Scorecard operationalizes A²I's core philosophy:

> **"Capability is cheap; coherence is scarce"**

By providing concrete, measurable dimensions of coherence using familiar business frameworks, the scorecard helps students:

1. **Diagnose** incoherence in AI initiatives systematically
2. **Communicate** coherence gaps to executives and stakeholders
3. **Improve** systems through targeted interventions
4. **Demonstrate** orchestration capability through measurable outcomes
5. **Lead** with evidence-based frameworks rather than technical jargon

This tool bridges the gap between the program's innovative vision and business school students' need for practical, actionable frameworks they can apply immediately in their organizations.
