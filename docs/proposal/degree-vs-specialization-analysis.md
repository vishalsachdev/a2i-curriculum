# A²I Program Options: Full MS Degree vs. iMBA Specialization

> **Document Purpose:** This document addresses Dean Elliott's critical question (#4) by presenting two strategic options for delivering Applied AI education at Gies College of Business: (1) a full MS in Applied AI & Business Systems, and (2) an iMBA Specialization in Applied AI. Both options are analyzed for strategic fit, market positioning, resource requirements, and risk profile.

---

## Executive Summary

**Dean's Key Question:** "Why create separate MS degree rather than AI specialization within proven iMBA?"

**Response:** Both options have merit and serve different strategic objectives. This document presents a dual-pathway approach that could maximize market reach while minimizing risk.

**Recommendation:** Consider a **phased approach**:
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Launch iMBA Specialization to test market demand and leverage existing infrastructure
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-18):** Based on Phase 1 results, decide whether to proceed with full MS degree or continue with specialization-only approach

---

## Context: Dean's Concerns from Review

From the dean's review document, key concerns about a separate MS degree include:

1. **Cannibalization Risk**: Competes with existing iMBA, MSBA, and MSTM programs
2. **Resource Intensity**: Requires new faculty, marketing, admissions infrastructure
3. **Accreditation Timeline**: New degree requires AACSB/HLC review (6-12 months)
4. **Market Uncertainty**: Unproven demand for separate MS vs. MBA specialization
5. **Opportunity Cost**: What programs don't get resources if we invest in new degree?

**This document addresses these concerns by:**
- Comparing resource requirements for both options
- Analyzing market positioning and differentiation
- Providing risk mitigation strategies
- Outlining decision criteria for choosing between options
