## Market Opportunity

### Industry Context

The integration of artificial intelligence into business operations has reached an inflection point. According to recent industry research:

- **McKinsey Global Survey (2024)**: 72% of organizations have adopted AI in at least one business function, up from 50% in 2020
- **Gartner (2024)**: AI augmentation will create $2.9 trillion of business value by 2025
- **PwC AI Predictions (2024)**: AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to global economy by 2030
- **IDC Spending Forecast**: Global AI spending to reach $300B+ annually by 2026

However, a critical gap exists:

> **McKinsey Finding**: "70% of AI initiatives fail to move beyond pilot stage due to organizational factors—not technological limitations."

The bottleneck is not technical capability but **strategic orchestration**: the ability to align AI initiatives with business strategy, manage change, ensure governance, and measure coherence.
