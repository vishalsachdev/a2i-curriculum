## Comparison: Specialization vs. Full MS Degree

| Dimension | iMBA Specialization | Full MS Degree |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Credits** | 8-12 credits (flexible options) | 36 credits |
| **Courses** | 4-6 courses (2 or 4 credits each) | 12 courses |
| **AI Focus** | 11-17% of degree | 100% AI focus |
| **Duration** | 2-3 years (with MBA) | 18-24 months |
| **Tuition** | $22-25K (iMBA pricing) | $45-55K |
| **Course Format** | Coursera + High Engagement (4-8 weeks) | 8-week courses |
| **Target Market** | MBA-seeking students | AI-focused professionals |
| **Startup Investment** | $150-300K | $700K-$1M |
| **Faculty Required** | 0.60-0.90 FTE | 4-7.5 FTE |
| **Time to Market** | 6-7 months | 12-18 months |

**Key Insight:** Both options can coexist, serving different market segments. The specialization serves MBA-seeking students, while the MS degree serves those who want deep AI focus without MBA. The specialization leverages existing iMBA infrastructure (Coursera + high engagement model), significantly reducing startup costs and time to market.
