## Contingency Planning

### If Approval is Delayed or Conditional

**Scenario 1: Curriculum Committee Requests Major Revisions**
- **Response**: Allocate 1-2 months for substantive revisions
- **Impact**: Delays timeline by 1-2 months
- **Mitigation**: Parallel workstreams on non-curriculum elements

**Scenario 2: Financial Concerns from Dean or Provost**
- **Response**: Revise financial model, identify external funding, phase implementation
- **Impact**: May require scope adjustments or longer timeline to break-even
- **Mitigation**: Demonstrate sensitivity analysis, phase 1 pilot reduces risk

**Scenario 3: Accreditation Substantive Change Required**
- **Response**: Engage accreditor early, prepare comprehensive documentation
- **Impact**: May add 3-6 months to timeline
- **Mitigation**: Begin documentation immediately, parallel implementation planning

**Scenario 4: Insufficient Faculty Resources**
- **Response**: Hire adjuncts/practitioners, partner with CS faculty, phase course development
- **Impact**: May limit first-year cohort size or delay launch
- **Mitigation**: Start with smaller cohort (20 students), scale as faculty hired

### If Approval is Denied

**Scenario: Proposal is rejected at any stage**
- **Response**: Understand reasons for rejection, determine if revisable
- **Options**:
  - Major revisions and re-submission (3-6 month delay)
  - Pivot to certificate program instead of degree
  - Pilot as executive education to demonstrate demand
  - Partner with another institution
  - Table proposal and revisit in 1-2 years
