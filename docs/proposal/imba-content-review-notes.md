## Recommended Review Process

### Step 1: Access Instructor Profile
1. Visit https://www.coursera.org/instructor/robert-brunner
2. Review list of courses/specializations taught
3. Note course titles, descriptions, and learning objectives

### Step 2: Review Course Content

For each course, assess:

#### Content Relevance
- **Data Analytics Foundations**: Relevant for Course 2 (Data & AI Infrastructure)
- **Statistical Methods**: Relevant for Course 3 (Evidence & Causality) if included
- **Business Intelligence**: Relevant for Course 1 (AI Strategy)
- **Case Studies**: Can be adapted for AI context

#### Content Gaps
- **AI-Specific Content**: What AI/ML content exists? What's missing?
- **Modern Platforms**: Coverage of cloud AI platforms (GCP, AWS, Azure)?
- **AI Governance**: Any content on AI ethics, governance, regulation?
- **AI Transformation**: Content on organizational change for AI?

#### Content Quality
- **Video Production**: Quality of existing videos (can be reused/adapted?)
- **Assessments**: Types of assessments used (can be adapted?)
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples that can be extended to AI context?

### Step 3: Content Mapping

Map existing content to proposed specialization courses:

| Existing Content | Proposed Course | Integration Strategy |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Data Analytics Foundations | Course 2: Data & AI Infrastructure | Use as foundation, add AI-specific modules |
| Statistical Methods | Course 3: Evidence & Causality (if included) | Extend to AI model evaluation |
| Business Intelligence | Course 1: AI Strategy | Adapt frameworks for AI context |
| Case Studies | All Courses | Extend existing cases to AI use cases |

### Step 4: Content Adaptation Plan

For each piece of existing content:

1. **Reuse As-Is**: Content that can be used without modification
2. **Adapt**: Content that needs minor modifications for AI context
3. **Extend**: Content that serves as foundation but needs significant AI additions
4. **Replace**: Content that is outdated or not relevant for AI specialization

## Other Gies Faculty Content to Review

### Potential Sources
- **Business Analytics Faculty**: May have analytics/statistics content
- **Information Systems Faculty**: May have technology/platform content
- **Strategy Faculty**: May have strategic frameworks content
- **Operations Faculty**: May have process optimization content

### Review Questions
1. What courses do Gies faculty currently teach on Coursera?
2. What content overlaps with proposed AI specialization?
3. What content can be leveraged vs. needs to be created new?
4. What faculty are available to teach in AI specialization?

## Content Development Strategy

### Option A: Maximum Leverage
- **Strategy**: Adapt as much existing content as possible
- **Pros**: Faster development, lower cost, leverages proven content
- **Cons**: May not be fully optimized for AI context
- **Timeline**: 4-6 months

### Option B: Balanced Approach (Recommended)
- **Strategy**: Leverage existing content where appropriate, create new for AI-specific topics
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds - efficiency + AI focus
- **Cons**: Requires careful integration planning
- **Timeline**: 5-7 months

### Option C: Mostly New Content
- **Strategy**: Create new content specifically for AI specialization
- **Pros**: Fully optimized for AI context, no adaptation needed
- **Cons**: Slower development, higher cost
- **Timeline**: 7-9 months

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Manual Review**: Access Professor Brunner's Coursera profile and review course listings
2. **Content Audit**: List all existing Gies/Coursera content relevant to AI specialization
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify what content exists vs. what needs to be created
4. **Adaptation Plan**: Develop detailed plan for leveraging existing content
5. **Development Timeline**: Revise timeline based on content leverage opportunities

3. **What content needs to be created new?**
   - AI-specific topics not covered?
   - Modern AI platforms and tools?
   - AI governance and ethics?

4. **What's the content development effort?**
   - How much can be adapted vs. created new?
   - What's the timeline impact?
   - What's the cost impact?
