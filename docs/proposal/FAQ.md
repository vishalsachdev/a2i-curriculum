## Strategic Questions

### Why now? What's the urgency?

**Answer:**

The AI transformation of business is accelerating rapidly, creating an urgent talent gap:

- **Industry Reality**: 72% of organizations have adopted AI, but 70% of initiatives fail due to organizational factors (not technology)
- **Talent Shortage**: 250% increase in AI strategy job postings (2022-2024) with insufficient qualified candidates
- **First-Mover Window**: No comprehensive business school MS degree exists yet—opportunity to be first
- **Student Demand**: Working professionals seeking to lead AI initiatives lack accessible pathways
- **Regulatory Environment**: Growing AI regulations (EU AI Act, GDPR, etc.) create demand for governance expertise

**Waiting costs us:**
- Competitors may launch similar programs (MIT, Stanford, Wharton all have resources to do so)
- Window for "first-mover" positioning closes
- Student pipeline goes elsewhere
- Miss revenue opportunity during high-growth phase

### What's the risk if we don't do this?

**Answer:**

**Missed Opportunity Risks:**
- **Revenue**: $25M-$35M potential revenue (5 years) goes to competitors
- **Reputation**: Competitors establish "first" and "leader" positioning in AI business education
- **Student Pipeline**: Lose working professionals interested in AI leadership to other institutions
- **Industry Partnerships**: Miss partnerships with companies seeking AI talent

**Strategic Risks:**
- **Perceived as Behind**: Peers launch AI programs while we don't—signal we're not innovative
- **Faculty Recruiting**: Difficulty attracting faculty interested in cutting-edge AI + business work
- **Alumni Relevance**: Alumni may perceive institution as not keeping pace with AI disruption

**Market Risks:**
- **Demand Doesn't Wait**: Companies need AI leaders now, will hire from programs that exist
- **Students Choose Elsewhere**: Working professionals pursue certificates or degrees from competitors
- **First-Mover Advantage Lost**: Being second or third loses media attention and differentiation

**Counter-argument**: "We can wait to see if demand materializes"
- **Response**: By the time demand is proven, multiple competitors will have launched and captured market share. Being late means competing without differentiation.

### How does this fit with our MBA program?

**Answer:**

**Complementary, not competitive:**

| **Dimension** | **MBA** | **A²I MS** |
|---|---|---|
| **Target Student** | Generalist managers, career switchers | AI-focused leaders, technical liaisons |
| **Duration** | 2 years full-time or 2-3 years part-time | 18-24 months part-time |
| **Breadth vs. Depth** | Broad business education | Deep focus on AI orchestration |
| **Career Outcome** | General management roles | AI/digital transformation leadership |
| **Cost** | $80K-$120K | $45K-$55K |

**Opportunities for Synergy:**
- **Cross-Enrollment**: A²I students may take MBA electives; MBA students may take A²I courses
- **Dual Degrees**: MBA+MS option for students seeking both breadth and depth
- **Shared Resources**: Faculty, platforms, student services
- **Alumni Network**: Expanded network benefits both programs

**Market Segmentation:**
- **MBA**: Students seeking broad business education or career change
- **A²I**: Students seeking to specialize in AI leadership without full MBA

**Why not just add AI track to MBA?**

This is a critical strategic question addressed in detail in our [`degree-vs-specialization-analysis.md`](./degree-vs-specialization-analysis.md) document. Both options have merit:

**Option A: Full MS Degree (Proposed)**
- Allows 36 credits of deep AI specialization (vs. 8-12 credits in MBA track)
- Targets students who want AI focus without full MBA
- Creates new brand positioning in AI business education
- Higher differentiation but requires more investment

**Option B: iMBA Specialization (Alternative)**
- Leverages existing iMBA infrastructure and brand (Coursera + high engagement)
- Lower risk, faster time to market (6-7 months vs. 12-18 months)
- Lower investment ($150-300K vs. $700K-$1M startup)
- Appeals to MBA-seeking students who want AI focus

**Recommended Approach:** Consider a phased launch starting with iMBA specialization to test market demand, then evaluate full MS degree based on results. See the full analysis document for detailed comparison, risk analysis, and implementation timeline.
