# Executive Summary: A²I Program Proposal

## The Opportunity

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping business operations, strategy, and competitive dynamics. Yet a critical gap exists: **organizations struggle to orchestrate AI initiatives effectively**. Technical talent can build AI systems, but few professionals can bridge the gap between technology and business strategy, manage AI portfolios, lead transformation initiatives, and ensure governance and coherence.

The proposed **Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence & Business Systems (A²I)** addresses this market need by developing **business leaders who orchestrate AI initiatives, not build algorithms**.

---

## Program Vision

> **"The first business degree designed for the AI era—where business leaders learn to orchestrate intelligence, not just consume it."**

### Core Insight
***Capability is cheap; coherence is scarce.***

As AI tools proliferate, the scarce skill is not technical capability but the ability to orchestrate people, data, and AI agents into coherent systems that deliver sustainable business value while maintaining governance, trust, and inclusion.

### Target Graduate Profile
A²I would produce graduates who:
- Lead AI transformation initiatives across organizations
- Evaluate and procure AI capabilities with financial rigor
- Design governance frameworks that balance innovation and risk
- Bridge technical teams and executive leadership
- Measure and improve business coherence across AI portfolios
