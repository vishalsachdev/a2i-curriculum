## 🔴 CRITICAL STRATEGIC QUESTIONS

### 1. Differentiation from Existing Gies Programs

**QUESTION:** How does A²I differentiate from existing **iMBA with Data Analytics specialization** and **MS in Management with Analytics focus**?

**Concerns:**
- iMBA students can already take courses in AI strategy, data science, and analytics
- MS in Management serves similar working professional demographic
- Tuition differential: iMBA is significantly lower cost vs. proposed A²I at $45-55K

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Clear articulation of what A²I offers that iMBA + analytics specialization cannot
- Why a student would choose A²I over proven, cheaper iMBA
- Evidence that market wants separate MS degree vs. MBA with AI focus
- How this complements (not cannibalizes) existing programs

---

### 2. Market Research Specific to Gies/Illinois

**QUESTION:** Where is the evidence that students would choose **Gies/Illinois** for this program vs. MIT, Stanford, or even Georgia Tech OMSCS at $7K?

**Concerns:**
- Proposal uses generic market data (LinkedIn, McKinsey) but nothing Illinois-specific
- No surveys of prospective students mentioning Gies
- No analysis of **why** students would pay $45-55K for Gies AI degree vs. competitors
- Brand recognition: Gies excels in business analytics, but are we known for AI leadership?

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Prospective student surveys mentioning Gies specifically
- Analysis of Gies brand strength in AI/tech markets
- Clear value proposition: "Why Gies?" not just "Why this program?"
- Competitive positioning against Georgia Tech ($7K), UT Austin ($10K), MIT/Stanford brand

---

### 3. Faculty Resources & Opportunity Cost

**QUESTION:** Do we have faculty capacity for this, and what's the opportunity cost?

**Concerns:**
- Proposal requests 8-10 core faculty (0.5-0.75 FTE each)
- Business analytics and information systems faculty are already teaching iMBA, MS Management, undergrad
- IS department has limited faculty - this would consume significant capacity
- What courses in existing programs would be cut or taught by adjuncts?

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Specific faculty names and their current teaching loads
- Analysis of impact on existing programs (iMBA, MS Management, undergrad)
- Plan for backfilling courses that get displaced
- Evidence that we can hire qualified new faculty (tight market for AI + business faculty)

---

### 4. Why Not MBA Specialization Instead?

**QUESTION:** Why create separate MS degree rather than AI specialization within proven iMBA?

**Advantages of iMBA Specialization:**
- Leverage existing brand and student pipeline
- Lower risk (test market with specialization before committing to new degree)
- Share resources with existing iMBA infrastructure
- Cross-selling: students get MBA + AI specialization
- Faster time to market (no new degree approval process)

**Disadvantages of Separate MS:**
- New degree = new accreditation review, longer approval timeline
- Competes with our own iMBA
- Higher price point may limit market
- More faculty resources required
- Duplicates some existing iMBA content (strategy, analytics, etc.)

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Compelling argument why separate degree is better strategic choice
- Analysis showing iMBA specialization wouldn't serve market
- Explanation of how this grows overall Gies enrollment vs. shifts students between programs

---

### 5. Revenue Projections Seem Optimistic

**QUESTION:** Are enrollment projections realistic given competitive landscape and Gies positioning?

**Concerns:**
- Proposal assumes 30 → 100 → 150 students in Years 1-3
- Georgia Tech OMSCS: 10,000 students at $7K (why not them?)
- MIT/Stanford brand recognition in AI (why not them?)
- UT Austin MSAI: 200+ students Year 1 (how do we compete?)
- iMBA success is due to competitive price + MBA brand - different market?

**Financial Modeling Issues:**
- Break-even assumes 50-75 students Year 2, but what if enrollment is only 20-30?
- High fixed costs ($700K-$1M startup) - what's contingency plan?
- Operating costs of $1.5M-$2M annually - can we sustain if enrollment lower than projected?

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Sensitivity analysis: What if enrollment is 50% of projections?
- Comparison to iMBA enrollment ramp (actual data, not projections)
- Conservative scenario with lower enrollment and contingency plans
- Market research showing students would choose Gies at $45-55K

---

### 6. Technical Prerequisites & Student Preparation

**QUESTION:** How do we ensure business students can handle technical content?

**Concerns:**
- Proposal says "no coding required" but courses involve:
  - Cloud platforms (GCP, BigQuery, Vertex AI)
  - Agent operations and evaluation
  - Data infrastructure and analytics engineering
- Target students are product managers, consultants - many lack technical background
- Risk of high attrition if students overwhelmed by technical demands

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Clear articulation of minimum technical prerequisites
- Pre-program bootcamp or bridge courses?
- Support systems for less technical students
- Evidence from peer programs on retention rates for non-technical students

---

### 7. Accreditation & AACSB Implications

**QUESTION:** Have you engaged with AACSB and regional accreditor about this program?

**AACSB Concerns:**
- Is this a "business" degree (AACSB) or "applied science" degree (different accreditation)?
- Faculty qualifications: Do we have enough SA/PA/AQ faculty for AI topics?
- Learning outcomes: Are these appropriate for business school MS degree?
- How does this fit within our existing AACSB continuous improvement plan?

**Process Concerns:**
- Substantive change notification required?
- Timeline: AACSB review could add 6-12 months
- Regional accreditor (HLC) also requires notification for new degree

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Confirmation that AACSB and HLC have been consulted (even informally)
- Faculty qualifications matrix showing SA/PA/AQ status
- Clear argument this is business degree, not applied CS degree
- Timeline accounting for accreditation reviews

---

### 8. Online Learning Quality & Student Experience

**QUESTION:** How does learning experience compare to our award-winning online programs?

**Gies Standards:**
- High production values and sophisticated learning analytics
- Strong peer interaction and community building
- High student satisfaction metrics

**A²I Proposal:**
- Mentions Coursera, Canvas, GCP, GitHub but no details on integration
- "Asynchronous-first" - how do we build community?
- Learning pods of 4-5 students - sufficient for cohort feeling?
- Content production costs seem low vs. typical online program investment

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Detailed student experience design (not just platform list)
- Content production plan at quality level matching existing programs
- Learning analytics and student support plan
- Comparison to existing program student satisfaction metrics

---

### 9. Industry Partnerships: Specifics Please

**QUESTION:** You list "potential partners" (P&G, Google, Amazon) - what's actually committed?

**Concerns:**
- Every proposal lists big-name potential partners
- Domain tracks depend on partnerships for credibility and capstone projects
- Without real partnerships, these are aspirational not operational

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Letters of intent from actual partners (not "potential")
- Specific commitments: guest lectures, capstone projects, hiring pipeline, financial support
- Advisory board members already committed (names, titles, companies)
- MOU or partnership agreements in draft form

---

### 10. Competitive Response Scenario

**QUESTION:** What if MIT Sloan or Stanford GSB launches comprehensive AI MS degree in next 12 months?

**Concerns:**
- MIT/Stanford have stronger AI brand recognition
- They can charge $80-120K (higher prestige)
- We're betting on "first mover" but that window may close fast
- If we're 2nd or 3rd, what's our differentiation?

**What needs to be addressed:**
- Contingency plan if major competitor launches first
- Sustainable differentiation beyond "first mover"
- Analysis of Gies competitive advantages that persist even if others launch
- Timeline showing we can launch before likely competitors

---
