- **4-7.5 FTE** faculty, **12-18 months** to launch
- Targets: AI-focused professionals (no MBA needed)

### Option B: iMBA Specialization in Applied AI
- **12-15 credits** AI specialization within MBA
- **$22-25K** tuition (iMBA pricing), **2-3 years** duration
- **$200K-$400K** startup, **$500K-$800K** annual operating

## Key Differences

| Factor | MS Degree | iMBA Specialization |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Risk Level** | Higher | Lower |
| **Time to Market** | 12-18 months | 6-9 months |
| **Investment** | $700K-$1M | $200K-$400K |
| **Market Segment** | AI specialists | MBA + AI |
| **Differentiation** | High | Medium |
| **Break-Even** | Year 2-3 | Year 1-2 |

## Recommended Approach: Phased Launch

### Phase 1: Launch iMBA Specialization (Months 1-9)
- Lower risk, faster time to market
- Leverages existing infrastructure
- Tests market demand
- **Investment:** $200-400K startup

### Phase 2: Evaluate MS Degree (Months 9-12)
- Analyze Phase 1 results
- Market research on deeper specialization demand
- Decision: Proceed with MS or continue specialization-only

### Phase 3: Launch MS Degree (Months 12-24, if approved)
- Complementary to specialization
- Targets different market segment
- **Investment:** Additional $700K-$1M startup

## Addressing Dean's Concerns

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Faculty capacity** | Phased approach: Start with 1-3 FTE, add 3-4 FTE if MS approved |
| **Cannibalization** | Clear positioning: Specialization enhances iMBA, MS targets non-MBA seekers |
| **Market uncertainty** | Test with specialization first, gather real data before larger investment |
| **Opportunity cost** | Low for specialization ($200-400K), can be funded from iMBA reserves |
| **Accreditation timeline** | Specialization avoids new degree approval (saves 6-12 months) |

## Decision Criteria for Phase 2

**Proceed with MS Degree if:**
- ✅ iMBA specialization enrollment > 100 students
- ✅ Market research shows demand for deeper specialization
- ✅ Students express interest in MS degree
- ✅ Faculty capacity available
- ✅ Budget available ($700K-$1M)

**Continue with Specialization Only if:**
- ✅ iMBA specialization meets market needs
- ✅ Students satisfied with MBA + AI track
- ✅ Resource constraints prevent MS launch
- ✅ Market demand insufficient for separate degree

## Next Steps

1. **Present analysis** to leadership for discussion
2. **Conduct market research** on demand for both options
3. **Develop curriculum** for iMBA specialization (4-5 courses)
4. **Create implementation plan** for Phase 1 launch
5. **Establish decision criteria** for Phase 2 evaluation
