# Online Delivery Adaptation for A²I Curriculum

## Overview

This section documents the comprehensive adaptation of the A²I curriculum for fully online, asynchronous-first delivery. The adaptation maintains the program's core vision of "orchestrating coherence" while embracing the unique opportunities and constraints of distributed global education.

## Key Principles

### 1. Asynchronous-First Design
Every component of the curriculum is designed to be accessible and effective for learners in any time zone, with optional synchronous enhancements.

### 2. AI-Native Learning
Leveraging AI not just as subject matter but as an integral part of the learning infrastructure, providing personalized support, feedback, and community building.

### 3. Global Accessibility
Content and experiences designed for learners with varying bandwidth, devices, and technical infrastructure.

### 4. Work-Integrated Learning
Recognizing that online learners are often working professionals, the curriculum integrates directly with their workplace contexts.
