# Implementation Appendices

> **📂 Note:** These documents contain detailed implementation plans and specifications that would be used **after program approval** during the implementation phase.

## Purpose of Appendices

The main proposal documents in `/docs` focus on:
- Vision and strategic value
- Learning outcomes and curriculum design
- Business case and market opportunity  
- Pedagogical approach and innovation

These appendices provide:
- Detailed operational plans
- Technical specifications
- Platform integration architectures
- Implementation scenarios

## Status

These documents represent thorough planning but are **not final operational plans**.

Upon program approval, these would be:
- ✅ Reviewed and refined with stakeholders
- ✅ Validated against actual budget and resources
- ✅ Updated based on leadership guidance
- ✅ Adapted to approved implementation timeline
- ✅ Adjusted for institutional partnerships and priorities

## Contents

### Online Delivery Detailed Specifications (`/online-delivery-detailed`)

- **assessment-transformation.md** – Portfolio-based assessment system
- **asynchronous-principles.md** – Time-zone agnostic learning design
- **digital-cohort-rituals.md** – Community building at scale
- **global-faculty-model.md** – Regional facilitator structure
- **learning-pods.md** – Small cohort accountability system
- **mobile-first-design.md** – Smartphone-optimized curriculum
- **platform-optimizations.md** – Technical performance specifications
- **studio-redesign.md** – Applied project studio format

### Platform Integration Specifications (`/platform-integration-specs`)

Technical integration architecture for learning platforms:

*Files would be moved here upon approval detailing:*
- Canvas LMS configuration
- Coursera content delivery setup
- GitHub Classroom integration
- Google Cloud Platform lab environments

### Operational Scenarios (`/operational-scenarios`)

Implementation planning for different scale scenarios:

*Files would be added here upon approval detailing:*
- 100-student cohort operations
- 500-student scale operations
- Implementation timeline (12-24 months)
- Resource allocation models
- Faculty hiring and training plans
- Student support infrastructure

## How to Use These Appendices

### For Approval Committees

Reference these appendices to:
- ✅ Understand implementation feasibility
- ✅ Assess resource requirements realistically
- ✅ Evaluate technical approaches
- ✅ Identify dependencies and risks
- ✅ Plan next steps after approval

### For Implementation Teams (Post-Approval)

Use these as starting points to:
- 📋 Develop detailed project plans
- 📋 Create platform integration specifications
- 📋 Build operational runbooks
- 📋 Design faculty training programs
- 📋 Establish student support systems

## Important Disclaimers

1. **Budget Estimates**: Any cost figures are preliminary and would need institutional validation
2. **Partnerships**: Mentioned partners (P&G, Patagonia, etc.) are aspirational, not confirmed
3. **Technology Selections**: Platform choices subject to institutional IT review and procurement
4. **Timelines**: Implementation schedules depend on approval timing and resource allocation
5. **Staffing**: Faculty and staff requirements are estimates pending organizational design
