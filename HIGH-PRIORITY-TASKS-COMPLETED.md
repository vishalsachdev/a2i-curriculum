## ✅ Completed High-Priority Tasks

### Task 4: Reframe Curriculum Content Files with Proposal Language

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Files Updated**:
1. **docs/curriculum/labs_and_capstone.md**
   - Added proposal disclaimer at top
   - Changed "Each studio is" → "Each studio would be"
   - Changed "Learners synthesize" → "Learners would synthesize"
   - Added "Proposed" to all section headers (Tracks, Requirements, Support Ecosystem, Assessment)

2. **docs/curriculum/electives.md**
   - Added comprehensive proposal disclaimer
   - Changed "Electives deepen" → "Electives would deepen"
   - Changed "Each track is structured" → "Each track would be structured"
   - Updated all "Partner Organizations" → "Potential Partner Organizations"
   - Updated all "Industry Partnership Framework" → "Proposed Industry Partnership Framework"
   - Changed "maintains" → "would maintain" for advisory boards

3. **docs/curriculum/overview.md**
   - Fixed "Maintains" → "Would maintain" for GitHub

4. **docs/proposal/stakeholder-benefits.md**
   - Changed "is designed" → "would be designed" (2 instances)
   - Changed "ensures" → "would ensure"

**Result**: All curriculum documentation now consistently uses proposal language.

### Task 6: Global Find-Replace Operations for Language Adjustments

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Systematic grep searches** across `/docs` directory for operational language patterns:
   - "the program provides" → None found
   - "our students" → None found
   - "faculty teach" → None found
   - "partners include" → None found
   - "we deliver/provide/offer" → None found
   - "maintains/establishes/implements" → Fixed remaining instances

2. **Verified clean state**:
   - No operational language assuming active program
   - Consistent use of "would", "proposed", "potential"
   - Appropriate conditional phrasing throughout

3. **Fixed edge cases**:
   - GitHub "Maintains" → "Would maintain"
   - "is designed" → "would be designed"
   - Partner organizations marked as "potential"

**Result**: Repository language is now consistently proposal-oriented across all documents.
